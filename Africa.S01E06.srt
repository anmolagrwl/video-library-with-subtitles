1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,720
Africa.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,799
In the four years
of making this series,

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,239
we've been to some
astonishing places

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,640
and seen animals behaving in ways
that have never been filmed before.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,439
ELEPHANT MOANS

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,080
But Africa has another story
to tell.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,839
The wildlife of this continent

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,719
has seen more changes
in the last 50 years

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,000
than it has in the last two million.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,519
Changing landscapes
and changing climate.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,959
Today's animals are facing
unprecedented challenges.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,879
Whilst around them,
Africa's human population

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,239
is growing at nearly double
the global rate.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,839
HIPPO ROARS

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,719
There is an increasing urgency
to understand

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,959
and, crucially, to conserve the
wildlife of this great continent.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,359
THEY WHISTLE

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,479
Today, there is a new generation
of naturalists and scientists

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,519
who are fighting
to save the wild places

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,399
and the animals that live in them.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,999
One, two, three!

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,719
This is the greatest wildlife
continent on the planet

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,839
and what happens here
is relevant to us all.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,040
So what is the future
of wild Africa?

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,039
This animal has become the world's
number-one target for poachers.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,959
Its kind has been hunted almost
to the point of extinction.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,599
It's now so rare
that this individual is watched over

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,119
day and night.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,079
This is the black rhinoceros.

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,919
And black rhinoceros are notorious
for being rather grumpy

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
and suddenly charging.

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,879
But he is in great danger,

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,320
because he has on his nose...

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,840
...that horn...

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,680
...which is worth its weight in gold.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,479
RHINO SNORTS

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,559
The demand for rhino horn
has rocketed.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,119
There has been a 3,000% increase
in poaching

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,440
just in the last five years.

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,240
Today, powdered rhino horn
can fetch up to 65,000 a kilo.

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,560
Rhinos are a lucrative target
for organised crime.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,079
In Chinese medicine, it's believed
that rhino horn can reduce fever

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,639
and some Vietnamese sell it
as a cure for everything,

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,839
from cancer to hangovers.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,959
It's made of keratin,
the same substance as hair and nail,

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,559
and it has no clinically proven
medicinal value.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,880
RHINO SNORTS

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,440
But it has made every black rhino
in Africa a target.

49
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,079
They've all been killed
in Uganda and Rwanda,

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,080
and there are only around
600 left here in Kenya.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,799
But these are not poachers.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,759
These are protectors.

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,879
GUN CLICKS

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,079
GUNSHOT

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
RHINOS GROAN

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,759
And that protection is overseen
by rhino expert Dr Matthew Mutinda,

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,560
one of the Kenya Wildlife Services'
top vets.

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,639
'Black rhinos
are critically endangered.'

59
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,759
That is what here, at Lewa Wildlife
Conservancy, we're trying to do...

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,759
save the animal,

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,839
provide a safe and secure sanctuary

62
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,320
where the animal can breed
and live freely.

63
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,919
There aren't many true wild rhinos
left in Africa.

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,119
Most, like these,
in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy,

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
are under armed guard.

66
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,480
This young female
has reached the age

67
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,559
when Matthew must do
some health checks,

68
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,319
including taking blood samples.

69
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,519
This will help deter
poachers and traffickers,

70
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,879
as DNA in illegally traded
rhino horn

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
can be tracked back to its origin.

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,759
If you have to do
anaesthesia in the wild,

73
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,520
you will expect some degree of risk.

74
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,719
This female has reacted badly
to the anaesthetic.

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,319
HE SPEAKS SWAHILI

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,479
She's not breathing.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,760
It's a rare and extremely serious
situation.

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,960
He knows that the next few minutes
are crucial.

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,239
And when an animal is this big,

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,600
there's only one way to get
the heart going again

81
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,720
when you're out in the bush.

82
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,519
Thanks to Matthew's quick thinking,

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
they can hear
that she is breathing again.

84
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,000
They've got to get her
back on her feet.

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,240
Not surprisingly,
she is disorientated.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,559
BANGING

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,840
RHINO GROANS

88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,039
RHINO GROANS

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,800
Mission accomplished.

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,039
It's been an ordeal,

91
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,799
but now, this rhino can be
tracked and protected

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
for the rest of her life.

93
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:28,560
Within minutes, she's grazing
peacefully again with her mother.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,039
It may seem heartless
to treat an animal like that,

95
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,479
but we have to keep tabs on them
and be able to identify individuals.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,079
They're in great danger.

97
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,559
Even now, on average,

98
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,240
one rhino is killed by poachers
every day in Africa.

99
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,799
There are so few black rhino
left in Kenya

100
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,760
that we're getting to know
each individual.

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,400
But this is still a creature
that can surprise us.

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,519
Previously, it was widely believed

103
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,480
that black rhinos were largely
solitary creatures.

104
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,399
Here, in the Kalahari,
a starlight camera reveals

105
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,959
that they may be much more sociable
than many thought.

106
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
RHINOS SNORT

107
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,879
THEY BELLOW

108
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,440
This water-hole gathering is an
enchanting window into the past.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,079
Early explorers reported seeing
a rhino behind every bush.

110
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,239
Before the invention of the gun,

111
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,359
there were probably
hundreds of thousands of rhinos

112
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
across the continent.

113
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,679
The people protecting rhinos
in Africa are striving to ensure

114
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,239
that we'll still be able to witness
wonderful scenes like this

115
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,200
in 50 years' time.

116
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,279
Right across Africa,
conservationists have realised

117
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,159
that if we want to save our
big animals, then now is the time.

118
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,719
The human population
of the continent

119
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,079
has just exceeded one billion

120
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,999
and many wild animals are being
hunted commercially for food.

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,039
Some, legally,

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,399
but many, illegally.

123
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,879
THEY BELLOW

124
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Wildlife meat is often sold
as goat or beef.

125
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,879
The amount is astonishing.

126
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,279
Millions of tonnes are eaten
across Africa every year.

127
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,959
At this rate, some species

128
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,640
are almost certainly heading
for extinction.

129
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,119
But commercial hunting is not
just affecting the grazers.

130
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,240
As the prey decreases,
it's affecting the predators too.

131
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,079
50 years ago,

132
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,559
there were about half a million
lions in Africa.

133
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,799
Today, there are less than 30,000.

134
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,319
But in one particular
part of Africa,

135
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,560
things are improving
in a quite extraordinary way.

136
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,480
These hunters have become part
of a new and unlikely alliance.

137
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,240
In recent years, hungry lions have
increasingly been killing livestock.

138
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,440
One group of traditional Maasai have
reacted in a very untraditional way.

139
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,959
The Maasai are cattle herders
who don't eat wild animals.

140
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,520
But when lions attack their herds,
they've always retaliated.

141
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,040
Maasai and lions
are ancient adversaries.

142
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,239
A lion hunt is still a rite of
passage for young Maasai warriors

143
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,880
like Olubi Lairumbe.

144
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,359
TRANSLATOR: For me and any Maasai,

145
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,759
killing a lion
is the ultimate fulfillment

146
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
of a truly accomplished Maasai.

147
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,759
Nothing compares to that.

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,519
There is nobody who knows more
about living alongside lions

149
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,719
than the Maasai themselves.

150
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,239
I met Olubi and some of the other
warriors in his village

151
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,519
to find out about their relationship
with the local pride.

152
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,560
How many lions are there
around here?

153
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,919
TRANSLATOR: Around here,
there are about 100.

154
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,320
So they all have names?

155
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,199
TRANSLATOR: Every single lion
has a name. A Maasai name.

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,919
And when you see a lion,

157
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,919
do you know how it's going
to behave?

158
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
TRANSLATOR: It depends on the lion.

159
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,799
For a Maasai warrior,
lions are nothing to be scared of.

160
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,359
But if I saw a lion, a lion
would be likely to attack me.

161
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,240
TRANSLATOR: Only if you threaten it.

162
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:22,639
Mmm, well, I hope
the next lion knows that.

163
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,160
THEY LAUGH

164
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,439
Olubi killed his first lion
when he was just 17,

165
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,800
after it attacked his cattle.

166
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,679
Unfortunately, the lion
turned out to be pregnant.

167
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,320
And that led to
a remarkable turnaround.

168
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,159
HE SPEAKS MAASAI

169
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,839
TRANSLATOR: The Maasai respect
all living things.

170
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,360
And I began to feel guilty
about the lion that I had killed.

171
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,400
In the end,
I came to admire the lions.

172
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,560
Olubi had a dramatic
change of heart.

173
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,600
He turned his back on hundreds
of years of Maasai tradition.

174
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,160
Along with some other warriors,
Olubi became a lion guardian.

175
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,640
Instead of hunting lions,
Olubi will be protecting them.

176
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,559
He teamed up
with Stephanie Dolrenry,

177
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,239
who helped pioneer the project.

178
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,919
THEY SPEAK MAASAI

179
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,239
Just by respecting their traditions

180
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,439
and also bringing in
their ecological knowledge,

181
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,119
it's been hugely successful.

182
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,719
They know their areas,
they know how to track lions,

183
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,158
they've been doing it
for generation after generation.

184
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,438
They know how to track them,

185
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,920
they know how to hunt them,
they know how to find them.

186
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,040
This is only a small-scale project.

187
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,599
But with lion numbers
as low as they are,

188
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
they need all the help they can get.

189
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,679
Olubi is tracking
radio-collared lions.

190
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,639
He's able to warn villages
to move their cattle

191
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,280
when the pride is in the area.

192
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,520
And so, they're avoiding conflict.

193
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,759
No lions have been killed
in the immediate area

194
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,559
since the project began.

195
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,719
By combining the science,
both ancient and contemporary,

196
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,279
they're beginning to make
a real difference.

197
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,439
There's so much to be learned.

198
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,999
I feel I bring in modern technology,
modern knowledge.

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,039
And, in return, they teach us
about the environment

200
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,759
and how things have changed
in their environment.

201
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,759
And it's a really neat exchange.

202
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,559
You can't say we're the biologists
or the teachers.

203
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,279
Or the guardians or the teachers.

204
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,279
We're both teachers
and we're both students

205
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,480
and I think that's...
That blend is amazing.

206
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,919
Critically, at the heart of this
project is a huge attitude change

207
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,239
by these Maasai warriors.

208
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,839
An animal that was once
their sworn enemy, they now protect.

209
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,879
'And their willingness to share
knowledge with other communities

210
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,119
'means that projects like this
could be repeated

211
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,119
'in other parts of Africa.'

212
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,319
Traditionally,
when a warrior killed a lion,

213
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,759
HE took the name of the lion.

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,039
Now, it's the other way round.

215
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,439
Now, the lion takes the name
of the warrior who protects it.

216
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,919
The scheme is a huge success.

217
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,199
There are about 100 lions involved
in the scheme in this neighbourhood.

218
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,440
This is 21st-century conservation
in action.

219
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,719
Perhaps the biggest threat
to wildlife

220
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,839
is the competition for space

221
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,360
with the rapidly-growing
human population.

222
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,879
The Virunga volcanoes
straddle the borders

223
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,480
of Rwanda, Uganda and
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

224
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,879
The rich volcanic soils
are extremely fertile.

225
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,560
It's one of the most intensively
cultivated areas in Africa.

226
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,719
But the farmers also share
this region

227
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
with one of our closest relatives.

228
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,039
This is home

229
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,200
to the last 800-or-so wild mountain
gorillas left on Earth.

230
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,639
We know a great deal
about these animals,

231
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,200
they've been closely studied
for 50 years.

232
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,480
One strong silverback male
keeps everyone in order.

233
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,680
And gorilla family life
is mostly peaceful.

234
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,879
Until a few generations ago,

235
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,439
mountain gorillas, hidden in
the seclusion of their forests

236
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,959
were seldom seen by human beings.

237
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,119
But their habitat was steadily
being carved away,

238
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,679
and now these gorillas are
marooned on the volcanic slopes

239
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,279
in a sea of farmland.

240
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,320
ROOSTER CROWS

241
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,879
The fact that gorillas now regularly
come into contact with people

242
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,039
not only means an increased
threat of poaching,

243
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,480
but also of disease.

244
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,479
Gorillas have little
or no resistance

245
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,320
to the bugs that we carry.

246
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,399
Numbers here once dropped
to around 250.

247
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,159
They were facing extinction.

248
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,639
ROOSTER CROWS

249
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,320
Action had to be taken.

250
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,199
The boundaries of the National Park
were strictly enforced,

251
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,399
halting the encroachment
of farmland.

252
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,039
And it was decided
that the only solution

253
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,520
was to intensively manage
the remaining gorillas.

254
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,280
Teams of scientists
constantly monitor them.

255
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,599
Their forests are patrolled
to cut poachers' snares.

256
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,759
CORD WHIPPING

257
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,559
And vets watch their health closely.

258
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,159
No, don't take it...

259
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,079
This is funded mostly
through eco-tourism

260
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,720
and donations from
all over the world.

261
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Mountain gorillas are now
back from the brink.

262
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,479
This level of human intervention
might not be ideal,

263
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,240
but it's working.

264
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,399
Every year, there are
a few more mountain gorillas

265
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,240
and, possibly,
just a little more optimism.

266
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,519
Intensive management
within a protected area

267
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
may represent the only future
for many African species.

268
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,480
But for some animals,
that is simply not possible.

269
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,359
What happens if the animal
you're trying to protect

270
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,040
is not suited to park life?

271
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,640
Elephants require vast amounts
of space to roam.

272
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,040
They have a range of
up to 1,300 square miles.

273
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,479
Given the chance, they will even
move between countries

274
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,559
in search of the best food.

275
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,320
Particularly, if conditions
get rough.

276
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,720
This was the scene
in Amboseli National Park in 2009.

277
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,239
The park is home
to nearly 1,500 elephants.

278
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,360
And this was the worst drought
for half a century.

279
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,120
60% of zebras and 95% of wildebeests
were wiped out.

280
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,039
The seasonal rains had failed
for the last two years.

281
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,920
And the elephants that lived here
were slowly starving.

282
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,360
The park created to protect them
is now surrounded by farmland.

283
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,800
The elephants had little choice
of where else to go.

284
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,159
Caught up in this catastrophe,
were three sisters.

285
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,520
They are the front line for elephant
protection in the park.

286
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,560
And they know these animals
better than anyone else.

287
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,279
Nora Njiraini
and Katito and Soila Sayialel.

288
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,239
You know, all the elephants
have been given names.

289
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,079
They are family to us.

290
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,680
Hello, Anastasia!

291
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,639
The sisters have been following
these elephants for over 25 years,

292
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,439
trying to ensure their safety,

293
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,679
particularly at times when life
is tough for these animals.

294
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,239
It really was terrible.

295
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,719
There was nothing actually
to feed on.

296
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,399
I even went and asked
the old Maasai men

297
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,119
whether they have ever experienced
such a drought.

298
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,880
The only time it was close
to what it was then, was in 1961.

299
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,200
In 2009...

300
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,679
...we lost quite a number
of elephants.

301
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,839
I think we lost about 400 elephants.

302
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,520
And it started with the young ones.

303
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,399
Elephants usually escape drought

304
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,199
by moving into other
less affected areas.

305
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,919
But Africa's human population is
growing at double the global rate.

306
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,999
And traditional migration routes
have been cut

307
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,599
by the development of towns,
cities, farmland and roads,

308
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,680
leaving these elephants stuck.

309
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
This young calf is starving...

310
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,000
...and there is nothing
they can do to help.

311
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,040
ELEPHANT MOANS

312
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,719
For the sisters,
who know each elephant personally,

313
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,800
this is a terrible moment.

314
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
It is something that we feel
in our hearts.

315
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,959
You can imagine the kind of feelings
that we get.

316
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,519
You know, knowing those elephants

317
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,240
and seeing something like that
happen. It really touches us.

318
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,519
It was a tough year for all
the young elephants in the region.

319
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,399
We lost all the calves
that were born that year.

320
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
All of them, we lost them.

321
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,119
ELEPHANT MOANS

322
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,280
There was nothing the sisters
could do to save the baby.

323
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,199
But they were determined to save
any elephants they could,

324
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,240
especially mothers
who could breed again.

325
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,479
They found this female
stuck in the mud,

326
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,920
exhausted in a dried-up lake bed.

327
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,800
ELEPHANT MOANS

328
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,440
The elephant that got stuck
in the mud was Kolida.

329
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,799
Poor thing, you know.

330
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,040
She was there
for quite a long time.

331
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,599
A Maasai reported it to us

332
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,760
and we had to combine efforts with
the Kenya Wildlife Services people.

333
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,560
ALL SHOUT

334
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,639
Weighing about three tonnes,

335
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,679
Kolida is just too heavy
to shift by hand.

336
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,560
She is weakening fast.

337
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,400
So the next morning,
heavy machinery is brought in.

338
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,200
THEY SHOUT

339
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,440
THEY WHISTLE

340
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,719
KOLIDA SNORTS

341
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,240
THEY SHOUT

342
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,239
After two days stuck in the mud,
Kolida is exhausted,

343
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,200
but she's up on her feet again.

344
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,039
The rains did return to Amboseli.

345
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,919
And thanks in part to the work
of those dedicated three women,

346
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,320
elephant numbers are now
beginning to rise again.

347
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,560
There's no doubt that this was
an extremely severe event.

348
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,080
But is it an isolated incident
or a developing pattern?

349
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,639
They say that with global warming,

350
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,079
we actually don't know
what's going to happen.

351
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,240
But we just have to cross fingers
and hope for a better future.

352
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,959
ELEPHANT SNORTS

353
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,959
Given the opportunity,

354
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,239
the numbers of elephants
in East Africa will recover.

355
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,879
Especially, if they're given
the freedom to range widely

356
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,680
and so avoid the harshest
conditions.

357
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,159
One solution to help elephants
find the space they need

358
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,999
is to link parks together

359
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,840
and provide safe routes
between them.

360
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,199
Elephants are great travellers

361
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,999
and here, in this part of Kenya,

362
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,639
they regularly moved
from the lowlands

363
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,439
up the side of the mountains
to feed in the forests up there.

364
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,399
But then, the human population
of Kenya grew

365
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,959
and roads like this one
were constructed,

366
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,359
penning the elephants
down in the lowland,

367
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,639
where they created havoc
amongst the farms.

368
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,039
Not only that, there were danger
of collisions on the road.

369
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,959
And then someone suggested
building an underpass.

370
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,359
Within 24 hours of it
being completed,

371
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,479
one elephant had passed through.

372
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,679
And now, all the elephants
use that route

373
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,600
to go up the mountain,
often at night, to feed.

374
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,919
Simple ideas like this underpass
are a lifeline for these elephants,

375
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,360
especially in times of drought.

376
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,559
Africa's climate
is certainly changing.

377
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,079
Some parts of the continent have
become 3.5 degrees centigrade hotter

378
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,880
in the past 20 years.

379
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,079
At the summit of Africa's most
famous mountain, Kilimanjaro,

380
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,320
80% of its permanent ice fields
have disappeared.

381
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,640
Soon, it will be
free of ice altogether.

382
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,479
All over Africa,
the mountainous regions are often

383
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,040
the first indicators
of climate change.

384
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,560
Here, in the Ethiopian Highlands
live very unusual-looking creatures.

385
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,440
Gelada baboons.

386
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,800
Climate change refugees.

387
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,919
Although this region of Ethiopia
lies in the tropics,

388
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,520
up at 4,000 metres,
it doesn't feel like it.

389
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,519
Unlike most African animals,

390
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,720
geladas are adapted
to life in the cold.

391
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,519
They used to be one of Africa's
most successful primates,

392
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,799
found all over the continent.

393
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,000
At one stage,
there were six different species.

394
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,880
Now, there is only one.

395
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,560
With the warming climate,

396
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:30,159
their grazing is becoming
more and more scarce,

397
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,840
restricted to cooler
and higher places.

398
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,000
These geladas are being forced
higher into the mountains.

399
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,120
Soon, there will be
nowhere left to go.

400
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,920
This is a species
living on the edge.

401
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,279
Even though they're isolated
on the mountain tops,

402
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,999
they're not immune to our influence.

403
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,119
As a result of changing climate,

404
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,800
these gelada baboons may soon
be gone from our planet.

405
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,280
Africa is the world's
hottest continent.

406
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
And there is no doubt
it's getting warmer.

407
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,799
The Sahara is the largest
hot desert in the world.

408
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,080
Very little can survive
in these harsh conditions.

409
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,479
Along the desert edge,

410
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,559
life clings on in the face
of encroaching sands.

411
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,520
But for how long?

412
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,359
Alongside the wildlife,

413
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,600
22 million people struggle to make
a living on these desert margins.

414
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,000
Can anything be done to stop the
sand overwhelming this fragile land?

415
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:20,239
One idea is to build a green wall
of trees across 11 countries.

416
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,799
The project has already started
in Senegal.

417
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,520
But like all big ideas,
it has big problems.

418
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,959
Getting 11 countries
to work together is not easy

419
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,319
and simply irrigating a 5,000-mile
long belt of trees

420
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,000
is an ambitious task.

421
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,039
But all over Africa, people are
recognising how important it is

422
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,080
to have trees as part
of their local landscape.

423
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,400
This group of volunteers has planted
nearly 100 million saplings.

424
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,639
They are just one of countless
similar groups and individuals

425
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,239
taking it upon themselves
to reforest their own part

426
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,000
of this great continent.

427
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,239
Trees are essential for the future
of the continent and indeed,

428
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,920
to the rest of the planet.

429
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,720
This is the Congo Basin.

430
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,799
It's one of the most biologically
important forests on Earth

431
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,639
and it's not just because
of the concentration

432
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,920
of plants and animals
that live here.

433
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,479
It's because it's also
one of the powerhouses

434
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,640
behind the planet's wind and rain.

435
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,319
Each hectare of trees
releases, as vapour,

436
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,160
almost 190,000 litres
of water a year.

437
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,799
This water passes into
the atmosphere to be transported

438
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,400
around the entire globe.

439
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,760
That means the heart of the world's
weather lies in tropical forests.

440
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,199
Unfortunately, there's an almost
insatiable demand

441
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,519
in Europe and China for hardwood
from these very forests.

442
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,960
And that is having
an enormous impact.

443
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,519
As more tropical forest is felled,
some scientists are seeing

444
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,279
a correlation with changing storm
patterns across Europe and America.

445
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,359
And it's likely to become
more extreme.

446
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,599
Staggeringly,
50% of the Congo Basin forest

447
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,040
has been allocated for logging.

448
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,280
The future of Africa's forest has
never been more critical for us all.

449
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,760
But the consequences of global
warming aren't limited to the land.

450
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,800
Africa is almost completely
surrounded by oceans.

451
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,400
Here on the east coast,
there are animals feeling

452
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,920
the changing climate
in a most surprising way.

453
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,439
This is a young female green turtle.

454
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,679
During her lifetime,
she will travel thousands of miles

455
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,920
through the ocean looking for food.

456
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,519
Turtles return to the same beach
from which they hatched

457
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,400
to lay their own eggs.

458
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,239
The eggs are buried in the sand

459
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,320
and the hatchlings will emerge
after about two months.

460
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,679
But there's a strange thing
about turtle eggs.

461
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,959
And that is the temperature
at which the eggs are kept

462
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,879
will determine the sex
of most of the hatchlings.

463
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,239
If the sand temperature is high,
they will be female,

464
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,320
if it's low, they will be male.

465
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,199
Global warming could have a crucial
effect on turtle populations.

466
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,479
And this young female may find it
very difficult in years to come

467
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,280
to find a male with which to mate.

468
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,279
But a local conservation group
recognised that the odds

469
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,160
are stacking up
against these little turtles.

470
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,359
There's not much they can do
about climate change,

471
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,999
but they have got together
with the local fishermen

472
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,919
to try and improve
the turtles' chances of survival.

473
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,159
Every turtle counts.

474
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,399
So, each time one is found injured
or accidentally caught in the nets,

475
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,999
it's brought to Kahindi Changawa
and his team.

476
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,999
So we began with only 16 fishermen

477
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,719
altogether in 1998.

478
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,960
Now we have hundreds of fishermen
working with us.

479
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,599
Grazing by turtles is essential for
the health of the beds of seagrass

480
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,879
and these are the home
of shrimps and lobsters

481
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,280
and that, of course,
helps fishermen too.

482
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,679
The project has
a turtle rehabilitation centre

483
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,440
and for the last two years,
it's become home to Sheila.

484
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,199
She had an accident with a boat.
It was a hit from behind.

485
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,479
She lost three ribs
and her spine was damaged.

486
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,520
It's now in the process
of healing back together.

487
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,999
Sheila's injuries
have affected her buoyancy.

488
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,159
She's healed well
and to encourage her

489
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,279
to exercise her flippers properly,
she has, every day,

490
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,160
a little trip to the seaside.

491
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,639
We usually take Sheila for
a sea bath on a daily basis,

492
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,359
and the reason for doing that

493
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,400
is to give her enough room
to get exercises.

494
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,879
She gets an opportunity
to eat her natural food.

495
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,199
We believe it keeps her fit
and the other thing is,

496
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,240
she gets to use her rear flippers
quite often.

497
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,880
For Kahindi, it's one of the rewards
for all his hard work.

498
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,359
It's really enjoyable. Very few
people have the privilege like I do

499
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,760
of swimming with the turtles
and having that fun.

500
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,400
I do enjoy what I'm doing.
HE CHUCKLES.

501
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,839
Sheila certainly did get stronger,
but the hope that some day

502
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,839
she might swim out in the open
was not to be fulfilled.

503
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,160
Unaccountably, she become weaker
and eventually died.

504
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,479
This kind of work will
inevitably have setbacks.

505
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,120
But there are always new turtles
to be cared for.

506
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,479
Is she healthy?
Yeah, this one is healthy.

507
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,000
She has a few bruises,
could be from the fishing gear.

508
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,839
Like these ones here.

509
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,879
Oh, yeah, but otherwise healthy.
Otherwise the turtle's healthy.

510
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,240
Shall we have a go?

511
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:09,039
Since 1998 till now,
we've released over 8,200 turtles.

512
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,679
It makes me feel proud and
privileged, we've done lots of work

513
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,599
with the community and changing
the attitudes and their behaviours.

514
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,840
I guess our job as an organisation
was really successful.

515
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,119
A young turtle like that
could lay 6,000-7,000 eggs

516
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,799
in her lifetime.

517
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,800
So, the survival of just one
could have huge consequences.

518
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,919
Saving just one individual
requires huge effort

519
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,199
and of course, saving a species
requires even more.

520
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,880
But these heroic efforts are only
ever going to be a partial solution.

521
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,879
Every individual animal is part
of a much bigger story,

522
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,919
part of an interconnected web
of plants, animals

523
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,040
and the landscape itself
that make up an entire ecosystem.

524
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,800
Saving ecosystems is the key
to Africa's wild future.

525
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,160
Gorongosa in Mozambique
is a modern day Jurassic Park.

526
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,160
It's ruled by some of the world's
biggest crocodiles.

527
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,399
Some of these monsters
are six metres long

528
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,320
and close to 50 years old.

529
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,599
Somehow they managed to escape
a civil war lasting nearly 20 years,

530
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,960
which swept through Gorongosa.

531
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,920
95% of all the other
large animals were wiped out.

532
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,000
But 50 years ago,
the scene was very different.

533
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,719
This was a thriving
tourist attraction.

534
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,639
A wild paradise. Visitors flocked
from around the world,

535
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,120
drawn by the vast range
and abundance of the wildlife.

536
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,559
The most popular spot for tourists
was an old restaurant,

537
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,600
a look-out post for the local lions.

538
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,279
The restaurant has long gone.

539
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,360
Along with the lions.

540
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,759
Gorongosa looked empty
and beyond rescue.

541
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,159
But not to everyone.

542
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,039
A brave and ambitious project began
to try and restore the park

543
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,959
to its former richness
and splendour.

544
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,959
The first stage is to find out
which animals as well as crocodiles

545
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,919
are still here.

546
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,919
So the team is mapping and counting

547
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,480
all the big animals they see
in the park.

548
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,839
But it soon became clear
that these big animals

549
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,040
were only part of the story.

550
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,520
Perhaps even more important might be
the little ones hidden underfoot.

551
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,599
It's understanding these creatures
that is attracting

552
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,280
some of the best minds
in the scientific world.

553
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,879
You were going to show me something?
Yep, something new.

554
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,519
Professor Ed Wilson is
a world expert on biodiversity

555
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,999
and at a mere 83, he's still
pursuing his passion - ants.

556
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,359
You see there's a big nest...
Wow. Let me just get one specimen.

557
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,319
If you look down at your feet,
you may see them.

558
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,119
Walking by here and there,
an ant, a little beetle...

559
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,280
They're what I like to call
the little things that run the Earth.

560
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,559
It's the rich diversity
of insect life here

561
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,080
that gives Gorongosa
the prospect of a future.

562
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,080
These creatures form
the basis of life in the park.

563
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,359
This is so much fun.
These little invertebrate creatures.

564
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,479
The creatures that do most
of the work, turn most of the energy,

565
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,999
save most of the material

566
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,319
and allow us to reinsert big animals
with some confidence.

567
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,519
Have you got it in the vial yet?
I've got three of them. Oh, good!

568
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,159
Professor Wilson was one
of the first scientists

569
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,999
to explore this area

570
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,520
together with local wildlife
biologist Tonga Tortuda.

571
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,439
If you could gather them all up,

572
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,719
all these little invertebrate
creatures, and weigh them,

573
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,839
they would weigh far more than
all of the big animals put together,

574
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,519
even in a fully restored park.

575
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,959
It's these little creatures,
together with the plants and trees,

576
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,079
that still make this place
a viable option

577
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,479
for reintroducing bigger animals.

578
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,639
I can't be sure that's a new species,

579
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,319
but this is the kind of thing
that might be.

580
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,640
This park came that close
to vanishing...

581
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,239
...And I'm happy to report
it is coming back.

582
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,999
And this is one of the great stories.

583
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,719
It's inspirational, I think.

584
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,919
It's a fine, shining example of
what to do with all our parks,

585
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,039
even those that have been damaged
by human activity.

586
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,439
But there's another reason
why Gorongosa is important

587
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,720
for the future of Africa
and perhaps for us all.

588
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:18,359
It is here, in this park, that people
come to see, not just the big animals

589
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,559
that thrill us, but they will see
Earth as it looked and felt

590
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,120
before the coming of humanity.

591
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,879
Saving big animals is important,

592
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,239
but to do that
with any real success,

593
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,559
we have to start understanding
and preserving the plants

594
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,480
and insects that support
an ecosystem.

595
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,599
It's this that will allow
the larger animals to thrive.

596
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,639
Gorongosa is a real success story.

597
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,599
The government and the management
team have pledged themselves

598
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,039
to a plan to restore the land
to what it was.

599
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,199
While it can never be exactly
the same as it was before the war,

600
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,520
it can still become
a rich and thriving ecosystem.

601
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,280
The scale of the challenge
across Africa is enormous.

602
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,720
After all, it's a huge continent.

603
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,559
The United Kingdom, China,

604
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,519
the United States of America, India,

605
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,559
Japan and most of the rest of Europe

606
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,560
would all fit within its borders.

607
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,960
Africa still retains 45% of
the Earth's uncultivated land.

608
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,159
It's still the greatest
wilderness on Earth

609
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,080
and that is why it's important.

610
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,839
Human beings have lived
alongside wildlife here

611
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,519
longer than anywhere else.

612
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,240
But now in the 21st century, animal
numbers are at a critical level.

613
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,559
Like it or not,
this generation is responsible

614
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,920
for handing on
the world's wildlife to the next.

615
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,199
That means taking care of the
animals and lands where they live,

616
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,800
so there is still space
for us all to coexist.

617
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:45,039
Nobody knows what the future
has in store for this little calf.

618
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,319
Or indeed, how the changes that
inevitably are going to take place

619
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,999
in Africa will affect the rest
of the world and this little animal.

620
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,519
But one thing is certain.

621
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,079
What happens here is more important
than it has ever been

622
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,479
and that the relationship
of the rest of the world

623
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,359
to this great continent
and the creatures that live in it

624
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,560
is more important than ever before.

625
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,399
On whichever part of the planet
we live, we all have a part to play

626
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,120
in what sort of future
this wild continent has.

627
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,759
Africa, the final shoot.

628
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,079
It's one of our most ambitious trips
with lots of locations to visit

629
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,679
and many technical hurdles
to overcome. Five, take one.

630
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,360
To the west are vast rainforests
the size of India.

631
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,759
Helicopters enable us to go
to extraordinary landscapes...

632
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,119
We're heading off to do
the very first visit,

633
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,319
the opening of the whole
Africa series with David.

634
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,599
How do you like the view
from my office?

635
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,199
HE CHUCKLES

636
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,519
...And attempt air-to-air filming.

637
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,119
'Stand by, David, and action!'

638
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,120
I'm flying over the
Great Rift Valley in East Africa.

639
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,639
But perhaps the most ambitious
task for this shoot

640
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,000
is the filming
with black rhinoceros.

641
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,439
They have a reputation for being
aggressive and with poor eyesight,

642
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,119
they're likely to charge objects
or people they don't recognise.

643
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,679
RHINO SNORTS, MAN YELPS

644
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,839
CRASHING, RHINO GRUNTS

645
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,519
But the plight of the rhino
is such an important story

646
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,399
that we want to get as close
to them as possible.

647
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,920
We also want to meet the people
who are working to protect them.

648
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,879
So our team have come to assess
the viability of filming up close

649
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,399
with a rhino called Elvis
who's been reared by humans.

650
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,759
He should be safer than a wild
rhino, but there's still a risk

651
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,400
he could be unpredictable
with strangers.

652
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,319
Wildlife ranger, Tonga Kaseyo
has brought up Elvis by hand

653
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,919
and knows that tickling him gently
with a stick keeps him calm.

654
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,279
But if anything were to go
seriously wrong,

655
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,999
there would be little he could do
against a one-tonne Elvis.

656
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,999
And this fact hasn't escaped
cameraman Mike Fox.

657
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,279
He knows we're here.
We're here on his terms.

658
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,479
If he decided to bat us all
into the next world...

659
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,440
he would do.

660
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,279
Director Kate Broome
checks with Tonga that it's safe

661
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,280
for the crew to get closer.

662
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,959
(Normally, we have to stay
in the Land Rovers.

663
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,080
(They're saying it's OK to go in.)

664
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,839
(This is such
an extraordinary opportunity,

665
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,999
(to be this close to...

666
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,840
(a black rhino.)

667
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,440
The trial goes well with Elvis and
the stage is set for future filming.

668
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,840
Several weeks later, the team are
back and this time I've joined them.

669
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,040
But Elvis's mood has changed.
He seems more wilful.

670
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,959
'Now, I've stood by many
wild animals in my time,

671
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,840
'but I'm not as fast on my pins
as I used to be.'

672
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,799
'We don't want to test
Elvis's patience,

673
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,159
so we get on with filming.'

674
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,760
A horn that is worth
its weight in gold.

675
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,120
And one way...

676
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,560
...of protecting him...

677
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,799
...would be...

678
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,440
to cut that horn off the nose.

679
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,599
How is it? It looks great.

680
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,039
'The team check that they have
what they need

681
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,839
'and Elvis lets us know
that he's had enough.'

682
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,439
Just watch out, everybody. Yeah.
I'll get out of the way.

683
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,239
'But actually, it's a positive sign

684
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,079
'that Elvis is not
as friendly this time.

685
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,879
'Tonga and his colleagues want Elvis
to live more like a wild rhino

686
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,239
'and develop a wariness of humans

687
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,600
'that may offer him
some protection from poachers.'

688
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,560
Good luck to you, Elvis.

689
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,079
Whilst filming, we're lucky enough
to have a very well equipped camp.

690
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,360
It's in the bush and there's
no escaping the wild animals.

691
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,759
One of the great,
wonderful things about

692
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,199
camping out in the middle
of the open is the animals.

693
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,119
But it can also be one of
the dangerous/annoying things.

694
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,320
Absolutely.

695
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,039
In the annoying category,

696
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,880
vervet monkeys.

697
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,279
Vervet monkeys have stolen
my Ferrero Rocher

698
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,999
and one of my glow sticks
from our medical supplies.

699
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,319
So, if we see a luminous-faced
monkey in the night,

700
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,119
I'll identify the naughty one
that's been stealing our stuff.

701
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,839
And they leave little presents for us

702
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,320
when they've been in,
just as a calling card.

703
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,759
But camp manager Andres
finds more worrying animal signs.

704
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,120
Well, the lions were quite close,
just behind the tents.

705
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,239
Some must have come in

706
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,599
and I don't know...

707
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,239
You can see a few scratches.

708
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,760
I think maybe he was wanting
to look at himself in the mirror.

709
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,639
'Lions in camp are worrying enough,

710
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,839
'but there I was
reading my book when...'

711
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,559
Uh-oh. Whoa!

712
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,440
'..A Cape buffalo arrives.'

713
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,400
'The most grumpy and dangerous
of the big five African animals.'

714
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,480
KATE: Mike! Stay in your tent.

715
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,320
Shall we get David
to get in the tent?

716
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,679
Buffalo usually move in herds,
so there's something odd about him.

717
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,599
It may be that it was brought up
as a calf and is humanised.

718
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,959
Or it may be that he's an outcast
from the herd in some way

719
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,679
and that he's rather grumpy
and fed up with life.

720
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,559
But I think it's just hot
and he's just plodding around

721
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,559
and wondering where he might get
a drink and a decent sandwich.

722
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,120
I feel the same way myself,
actually.

723
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,199
The team's filming has coincided
with the newest arrival at Lewa,

724
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,720
a baby rhino
in need of 24-hour care.

725
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,239
This little chap was born blind

726
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,560
and is guided everywhere
by his keepers.

727
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,439
They took him away
from his mother a few weeks ago,

728
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,759
because she couldn't
protect him any more.

729
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,400
He's very vulnerable so he would
have been killed by predators.

730
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,799
It's like filling up a petrol tank.

731
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,719
'Every rhino is precious

732
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,840
'and so it seems a fitting end
for the final scene of the series.'

733
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:36,799
No-one knows what the future holds
for this little creature,

734
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,199
nor indeed what changes
will take place

735
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,000
on the great continent
on which he lives.

736
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,079
David, I found that...

737
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,799
Oh, gosh. There's ants... everywhere.
That's what it is.

738
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,720
Yeah, hang on. Ants. Ant attack!

739
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,439
I just found that
extraordinarily moving, actually.

740
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,199
What I said was all right?
Yes. Are you sure?

741
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,680
And how you did it,
it made me cry, I'm afraid, so...

742
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,960
David Attenborough's made me cry.

743
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,880
But just as we think we're
finishing, someone won't let us go.

744
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,280
Hello, little fellow.

745
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,639
'He starts to squeak and we're able
to have a little chat.'

746
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,319
THE RHINO SQUEAKS Oh!

747
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,119
Oh!

748
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,519
Oh!

749
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,479
Oh.

750
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,479
Oh. Mm.

751
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,239
Oh!

752
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,359
'Think about it,
he's got a black world, hasn't he?

753
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,119
'And he's got smell
and he's got sound, so...'

754
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:11,039
He's more likely to be responding to
sound if he hasn't got the vision.

755
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,599
'He's just inquisitive, I suppose.'

756
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,880
Are you coming back?

757
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,559
Oh!

758
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,080
THE RHINO SQUEAKS

759
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,839
'There is hope
for this little fellow.

760
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,439
'He's due to have an operation
on his eyes which may mean

'that as an adult
he can be returned to the wild

762

'just like Elvis.'

763
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,399
I do hope he gets
a cataract operation.

764

It would be marvellous if he did.

765

Enchanting creature.
