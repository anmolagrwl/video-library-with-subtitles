1
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,240
ROARING YAWN

2
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,559
I'm flying over the Great
Rift Valley in East Africa.

3
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,519
And below me,
is a landscape in turmoil,

4
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,640
torn apart by the twisting
and buckling of the Earth's crust.

5
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,639
It's also a landscape of huge
and unpredictable change,

6
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,079
that forces animals, day by day,
season by season,

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,879
to gamble with their lives.

8
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,959
But for those that win,

9
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,440
this is one of the most fertile
landscapes on Earth.

10
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,680
Nyiragongo, the largest lava lake
in the world...

11
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,600
...bubbling up from nearly
ten miles beneath the surface.

12
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,200
Nowhere takes you closer to
the fiery heart of the planet.

13
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,560
Mount Nyiragongo is one of the most
active volcanoes in Africa.

14
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,840
Its eruptions
can be seen from space.

15
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,999
As magma churns
below the Earth's crust,

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,120
the land to the east of here
is being torn apart.

17
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Volcanoes like this are continually
changing the face of Eastern Africa.

18
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,880
The volcanoes here
may have a violent side...

19
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,600
...but life flows from
these infernos.

20
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,080
Fertile ash from countless
eruptions carpets the land...

21
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,239
...creating the ideal conditions
for grasses to flourish,

22
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,840
on an immense scale.

23
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,479
And with the grasses come animals in
numbers found nowhere else on Earth.

24
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,720
Wildebeest.

25
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,840
Nothing stands in their way.

26
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,840
All this, just to reach fresh grass.

27
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,000
WILDEBEEST GRUNT

28
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
The ever-travelling herds are only
one element of life here.

29
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,640
Look closer
and there are new stories to tell.

30
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,639
Living on the savannah
is about making the most of the hand

31
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,480
the landscape deals you.

32
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,640
But here, it's always a gamble -
everything may change tomorrow.

33
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,519
From their vantage point,
agama lizards

34
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,040
wait for the arrival of the herds,
ready to seize their moment.

35
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,960
It's payday - over a million
wildebeest on their doorstep.

36
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,959
And with the wildebeest come flying
insects - billions of them.

37
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,999
BUZZING

38
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,960
Food -
if only they could catch them!

39
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,720
Time for a rethink.

40
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,960
This agama lizard
has spotted an opportunity.

41
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,080
Only one thing attracts more flies
than the wildebeest...

42
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,040
...lions that have eaten wildebeest.

43
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,239
Lions are famously bad tempered...

44
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
they could swat the lizard like
the flies he's hoping to ambush.

45
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,320
He will need to pick his target
carefully.

46
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,640
LOW GROWL

47
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,520
Not her.

48
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
Or her.

49
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Maybe?

50
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,039
But no.

51
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,480
LIONESS RUMBLES

52
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,920
To be within striking distance,
he's got to hold his nerve.

53
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,040
Got one!

54
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,520
Now he's getting his eye in.

55
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,480
LIONESS RUMBLES

56
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,200
But this might be a bit ambitious.

57
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,400
It may take courage to hunt
on the back of a lion...

58
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,240
LION RUMBLES

59
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,760
...but it takes sense to know
when to run away!

60
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,919
The wildebeest won't stay for long,
and when they leave,

61
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,640
most of the flies will follow.

62
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,400
Change is everywhere in East Africa.

63
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,959
This grassland was once covered by
a forest that ran

64
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,240
unbroken from west coast
to east coast.

65
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,359
Today, high above the plains,

66
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,040
swirling clouds hide mountains that
tower three miles into the sky.

67
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,319
These frozen summits now form part
of a mountainous barrier separating

68
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,720
the ancient jungles in the west
from the savannahs of the east.

69
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,199
Up here,
lies the largest glacier in Africa,

70
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,520
just a few miles north
of the equator.

71
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,640
These are the legendary
Mountains of the Moon.

72
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,320
The height of these peaks means
they create their own weather.

73
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,639
The local name for these mountains
is "Rwenzori"...

74
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,200
"the rain maker".

75
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,720
WATER DRIPPING

76
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,680
Meltwater flows down
from the glaciers.

77
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,599
And on the lower slopes, all this
water supports thick jungle...

78
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,480
PIPING AND TRILLING BIRDSONG

79
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,359
...remnants of the dense,

80
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,560
steamy forests that once dominated
the whole of East Africa.

81
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,279
But driven by a drying climate
beyond the mountains,

82
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,000
the forests began to wither away.

83
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,559
Today, only small pockets
of upland jungle remain...

84
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,280
home to animals
who once roamed the ancient forests.

85
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,039
The largest living
primates on Earth.

86
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,280
GORILLA GRUNTS

87
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
Mountain gorillas.

88
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,080
GORILLA BABY SQUEALS

89
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,079
This little one's ancestors
have lived in forests like these

90
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
for millions of years.

91
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,000
But all around, the world
has changed to swamp and savannah.

92
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,239
This is the furthest
these mighty giants

93
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
now venture into Eastern Africa.

94
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,360
They're marooned on their islands
in the African sky.

95
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,679
Below the highlands,

96
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,360
vast wetlands cut swathes
through the open savannah.

97
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,480
BIRDS CHIRRUP

98
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,759
Bangweulu Swamp is huge...

99
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,920
its name means,
"where the water meets the sky".

100
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,639
Hidden amongst
this maze of waterways

101
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,200
is a creature like no other.

102
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,200
A giant, prehistoric-looking bird.

103
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,000
A shoebill.

104
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,719
Standing well over a metre tall...

105
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,440
she roams these swamps...

106
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,080
...trying to catch catfish.

107
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,000
Not exactly what she was after.

108
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,040
Deeper into the swamp, lies
the reason for all this fishing.

109
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,000
This chick is just three weeks old
and a little bit wobbly on its feet.

110
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,599
Its vast bill
means it has trouble balancing.

111
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,240
It won't be able to fly, or even
walk properly for several weeks.

112
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,599
HONKING CALL

113
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,639
It's entirely reliant
on its parents for food and water.

114
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
SQUEAKING CALL

115
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,759
There is also a smaller chick,

116
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
who isn't doing so well.

117
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,080
CHICK'S LOW HONKING CALLS

118
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,360
The larger chick
pesters its mother for a drink.

119
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,079
While she goes off to fetch water,

120
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,800
it reveals a dark side to
the relationship with its nest mate.

121
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,479
It's three days older than
the other chick,

122
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,400
and has always won the race
for food and attention.

123
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,680
This is more than just
a scrap between two siblings.

124
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,640
As their mother returns, she sees
what the larger chick has done.

125
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,199
The smaller chick
seeks its mother's comfort.

126
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
CHICK SQUAWKS

127
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,520
But she has already made her choice.

128
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,960
Only her first-born
will get a drink.

129
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,320
Shoebills very rarely
raise more than one chick.

130
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,679
The younger chick
was only ever an insurance,

131
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,240
in case the elder didn't make it.

132
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,439
Now it's old enough,
the adults know that

133
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,839
they're better off
putting all their efforts

134
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,920
into bringing up
just one fit and healthy youngster.

135
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,039
The swamp's changing water levels
mean fishing

136
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,359
is too unpredictable for them

137
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,640
to gamble on trying to raise
two chicks.

138
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,200
Nothing here
stays the same for long.

139
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,719
This is the time of year when
Eastern Africa is beginning to dry.

140
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,199
HIPPOS SNORT AND ROAR

141
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,080
The rivers and waterholes
are shrinking.

142
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,040
The land continues to dry out.

143
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Tensions rise.

144
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,480
Hippos seek what relief they can.

145
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,559
This time of relentless drying

146
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,640
is also when another force of change
ravages the land.

147
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,320
Without warning, fires rip through
these tinder-dry plains.

148
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,679
The flames sweep across the savannah
at 50 miles an hour...

149
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,719
reaching temperatures of nearly
a thousand degrees,

150
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,840
consuming everything in their path.

151
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,160
Each year, an area larger than
Britain goes up in smoke.

152
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,399
But this destruction
can bring opportunity,

153
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
if you're prepared to take a risk.

154
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,439
Drongos, bee-eaters

155
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,560
and rollers bravely pluck fleeing
insects from amongst the flames.

156
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,960
There's little better than
a char-grilled grasshopper.

157
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,879
These fires may appear devastating,
but they are, in fact,

158
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,599
part of a natural cycle that
is essential for the regeneration

159
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,960
of East Africa's grasslands.

160
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,320
But sometimes the cycle is broken,
just when a change is most needed.

161
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,559
Here, on the plains of Amboseli,
in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro,

162
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,200
the seasonal rains have failed
for the last two years.

163
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,040
And this year,
they are already long overdue.

164
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,000
It's the hardest drought
for half a century.

165
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,520
ELEPHANTS TRUMPET

166
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,760
ELEPHANTS TRUMPET

167
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,760
Amboseli is usually
a haven for elephants.

168
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,640
These plains should be green
and covered with grass.

169
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,880
Now there is nothing but dust.

170
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,399
This family is forced to travel

171
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,759
constantly,

172
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,680
searching for anything they can eat.

173
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,759
ELEPHANTS GRUNT

174
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,359
The young must keep up, sometimes
there's not even time to suckle.

175
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,680
ELEPHANT BABY SQUAWKS

176
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,920
With the grass gone,

177
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:56,640
all the elephants can scratch
from the dust is withered twigs.

178
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,359
The adults
might just survive on this,

179
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,080
but it will not support
a calf for long.

180
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,399
Every mother in the herd

181
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,680
is struggling to provide
milk for her calf.

182
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,840
The search for food
is increasingly urgent.

183
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,520
As the herd moves on,
this female faces a terrible choice.

184
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,919
To carry on with her family,

185
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,799
or stay behind with her calf,

186
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,320
who's becoming too weak
to even stand.

187
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,480
They will soon be out of sight.

188
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,840
But her instinct is to stay.

189
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,479
CALF SQUEALS

190
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,680
MOTHER ELEPHANT BAYS

191
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,960
She won't abandon her baby.

192
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,240
CALF SQUEAKS

193
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,520
MOTHER ELEPHANT BAYS

194
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,320
MOTHER ELEPHANT BAYS

195
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,600
MOTHER ELEPHANT BAYS

196
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,680
BABY ELEPHANT WHEEZES SOFTLY

197
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,520
With the calf's last breath,
she knows that her battle is lost.

198
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,440
MOTHER ELEPHANT RUMBLES

199
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,640
There ARE places even more hostile
than the dust-choked plains.

200
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,119
These alien landscapes are actually
the sun-baked salt crusts

201
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,680
of a chain of lakes
that run through East Africa.

202
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,919
The face of these soda lakes
changes day by day,

203
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,560
as the sun evaporates the water,
leaving the salts behind.

204
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,480
The waters here are toxic,
poisoned by volcanic springs.

205
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,840
But life does exist, even here.

206
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,239
The strange colours
are created by algae,

207
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,280
specially adapted to live in
this corrosive liquid.

208
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,639
And it is these algae that attract

209
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,880
one of the most astonishing
animals found in East Africa.

210
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,360
SQUAWKING

211
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,560
WATER LAPS NOISILY

212
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,199
Among the steaming geysers
of Lake Bogoria,

213
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,920
over a million lesser flamingos
bathe and feed in the caustic water.

214
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,559
They gather
whenever the algae bloom.

215
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,400
LOUD SQUAWKING

216
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,679
These huge numbers

217
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,960
create one of the greatest
wildlife spectacles on Earth.

218
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,679
Almost all the world's
lesser flamingos

219
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,799
live on this chain of lakes,

220
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,200
moving from one lake to another as
the amount of algae in each changes.

221
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,559
All along the lake shore,
volcanic vents are a reminder

222
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,520
of the forces that continue
to change this land.

223
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,759
And a streak of colour
on the horizon

224
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,280
signals that relief for
the parched plains is on its way.

225
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,479
THUNDERCLAPS

226
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,440
RAIN FALLS

227
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,320
At last, countless storms
drench the thirsty ground.

228
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,679
Rain changes everything, yet again.

229
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,759
LIGHTNING CRACKLES

230
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
THUNDERCLAPS

231
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,359
A crowned eagle
has been desperately waiting

232
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,959
for what she hopes the rain
will bring...

233
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,439
CHIRPING

234
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,400
...food for her hungry chick.

235
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,360
Nesting here has been
her biggest gamble.

236
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,039
Her chick's life depends on
the arrival of creatures

237
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,119
from the far rainforests
of the Congo.

238
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,520
THUNDERCLAPS

239
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,439
Her wait will soon be over.

240
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,439
The largest mammal migration
in Africa is on the move.

241
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,280
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING

242
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,879
Ten million fruit bats are drawn to
this tiny forest,

243
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,000
on the edge of the eastern savannah.

244
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,640
The bats flock here
to gorge themselves on fruit.

245
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,360
It's what the crowned eagle
and her chick have been waiting for.

246
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,159
But they're not alone.

247
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,200
Other eagles have flown in
from miles around...

248
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,039
...fish eagles,

249
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,079
martial eagles,

250
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,040
and they're all after the bats.

251
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,680
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING

252
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,080
SQUEAKING, WING FLAPPING

253
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,559
The gamble the crowned eagle took
months ago by nesting here

254
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,880
has paid off.

255
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,279
She is the only eagle to actually
nest in this forest.

256
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,240
CHIRPING

257
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,999
The only one who took
the risk to breed here,

258
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
well before the trees came
into fruit and the bats flooded in.

259
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,919
She only breeds
once every two years,

260
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,240
so her timing must be perfect.

261
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,479
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING

262
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,239
In a few months,
the bats will leave,

263
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,879
but her gamble means her chick

264
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,240
will have the best possible start
in life.

265
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,239
These grasslands have been
grazed and burned

266
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,600
and have endured the harshest
drought in generations...

267
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,559
FLIES BUZZ

268
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,399
...but with the rains,
they're beginning to recover.

269
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,760

THEY GROWL

274
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,119
And on the once dust-choked plains
of Amboseli,

275
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,480
there's a return to the good times.

276

ELEPHANTS BELLOW

277
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,239
The drought here
killed hundreds of elephants,

278
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,200
but the survivors
are now returning home.

279
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,599
And with them,
there's a surprise.

280
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
HIGH-PITCHED GRUNTING

281
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,760

HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL

Surrounded by food,

286
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,200
the youngster can concentrate
on more important things...

287
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,839
...like chasing egrets.

288

LOW-PITCHED GROWLING

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,760
THEY GROWL AND HISS

294
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,959
This bull has waited many years

295
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,720
for his chance to father
the next generation.

296
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,759
Now, he must
fight his way to the top.

297
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,520
LOW-PITCHED GROWL

298
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,240
But his rival is massive.

299
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,840
Each of their heads
weighs as much as a car.

300
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,559
They have been duelling for days.

301
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,680
GRUNTING

LOW-PITCHED GROWLING

303
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,160
Now in its third day,
the contest is reaching a climax.

304
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,280
ROARING

305
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,240
Soon, one will be forced to concede.

306
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,840
GRUNTING

LOW-PITCHED HOWLING

00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,320
CRASHING AND CREAKING

Three days of battle is at an end.

312
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,800
The victor has won the right
to the females.

313
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,880
The process to replace what
the drought took away has begun.

314
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,760
Soon, the elephants will be
at full strength again.

315
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,159
Every day, the animals of Eastern
Africa gamble with their lives,

316
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,799
but despite the continual changes
they face,

317
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,359
their extraordinary adaptability

318
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,640
just tips the odds of survival
in their favour.

319
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,159
East Africa may seem very cruel,

320
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,959
but there's nowhere else that
provides such rich opportunities

321
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,399
for those that are prepared
to take them.

322
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,919
And in the end,
it was these ever-changing savannahs

323
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,999
that produced
the most adaptable species of all...

324
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,440
ourselves.

325
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,240
ENGINE REVS

326
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,879
Filming in East Africa

327
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,759
would take the team on both
a physical and emotional journey

328
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,120
through the extremes
of this landscape.

329
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,559
These are the legendary
Mountains of the Moon,

330
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,360
towering over 5,000 metres
into the African sky.

331
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,359
Just miles from the equator,

332
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,239
they're the highest
mountain range on the continent

333
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,760
and home to
the largest glacier in Africa.

334
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,799
To reach the summits,
the team had to travel on foot,

335
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,479
the same way as climbers did
when they first reached the top

336
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,400
just over 100 years ago.

337
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,399
It would take more than two weeks,

338
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,480
climbing over 3,000 metres
from the valleys below.

339
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,759
Six days into their trek,
still well below the summits,

340
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,159
the team come to realise why
Rwenzori, the mountains' other name,

341
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,440
means "the rain makers".

342
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,639
Just after we set off, it started
raining, then it started hailing,

343
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,719
and the idea had been that
we'd stop here for an hour or two

344
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,479
and do some shots.
But as you can probably see,

345
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,959
there's not a great deal of view.

346
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,639
Brilliant shots of rain
and hail and fog.

347
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,519
Beyond that, we're pretty stuffed,
so it's becoming a bit of a theme.

348
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,279
For the crew and over
75 guides and helpers,

349
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,599
it's hard going carrying
nearly a tonne of kit

350
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,240
through the marshy valleys.

351
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,159
Mud, mud,

352
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,080
and just a little bit more mud.

353
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,039
But it's not just the bogs
they have to deal with.

354
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,799
There was a small, but slightly
disconcerting, earthquake last night,

355
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,480
so let's hope we don't get any
of those below any rocks.

356
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,560
The team continue to climb and,
before long, the rain turns to snow.

357
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,239
They eventually arrive
at the highest hut,

358
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,239
surrounded by ice
and nearly three miles up.

359
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,399
This will be base camp for the crew.

360
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,320
We've got a kitchen over there.

361
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,959
Um...

362
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,439
over there, down a really
treacherous precipice, is the toilet,

363
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,200
which is just a shack
with a big hole in the floor.

364
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,599
From here, they'll make
the hardest part of the ascent

365
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,240
right up to the glaciers.

366
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,959
Well, this is, believe it or not,
one of the better viewpoints

367
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,759
so... probably going to hang around
here for a little while,

368
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,799
wait till the fog clears.

369
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,680
But the weather isn't on their side.

370
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,959
So much for hoping the weather
was going to get better.

371
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,280
All that optimism now seems
completely ill-founded.

372
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,439
With the storm clouds closing in,
the team are forced to retreat.

373
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,400
THUNDERCLAPS

374
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,359
This enormous weather front's
come in, as isn't entirely unusual.

375
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,119
So we're just coming down
as the thunder bursts around us.

376
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,119
So, glad to get back and go
and get inside the hut

377
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,680
and hopefully weather it out.

378
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,239
After days of climbing and finding
the peaks hidden by fog,

379
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,640
filming the summits is looking
increasingly impossible.

380
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,000
It can be pretty frustrating
at times.

381
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:21,479
There's a group of maybe 70 people
that we've involved directly.

382
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,439
You get all the way up here,

383
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,599
and then we can't film anything
because of the weather.

384
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,119
So, it is just a matter
of sitting it out and waiting.

385
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,880
You have to sort of hope that things
come right in the end.

386
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,679
The "rain makers" are certainly
living up to their name,

387
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,839
but by complete contrast,

388
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,680
other parts of East Africa
were gripped by drought.

389
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,159
At the beginning of the production,
Mark Deeble travelled to Amboseli,

390
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,679
just a few hundred miles
from the Rwenzoris,

391
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,000
to film the plight
of the animals there.

392
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,519
I mean,

393
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,480
I've never seen anything
quite as bad as that drought.

394
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,839
And we talked to
some of the Masai elders.

395
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,120
They said it was the worst drought
they'd seen in 50 years.

396
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,559
Amboseli is famous for
its huge herds of elephant,

397
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,119
but the drought
had dispersed them far and wide.

398
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,160
Those that remained were struggling
to find what little food was left.

399
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,319
When we first saw the group,
we could tell instantly

400
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,640
that they were in
a really serious condition.

401
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,919
They were thin
and obviously starving.

402
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,999
ELEPHANT BAYS

403
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,479
Mark knew that many of the calves
would not survive.

404
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,159
Although desperately painful
to witness,

405
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,399
nothing would convey
the cruel power of the drought

406
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,600
more than this mother's struggle
to keep her baby alive.

407
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,319
The thing about filming
a situation like that...

408
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,639
You know, when
an elephant calf dies,

409
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,799
is that when
you're actually filming it,

410
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,359
you're so caught up in the moment.

411
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,639
ELEPHANT BAYS

412
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,080
But it was only after filming,

413
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:08,279
when I put the camera away
and I looked there,

414
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,399
and there was this dead calf and
the mother standing there grieving,

415
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,280
that the full impact
of what I'd just filmed hit me.

416
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,279
People often say to me, you know,

417
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,280
"Could you not have intervened
in a situation like that?"

418
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,399
There are times when you CAN help,

419
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,039
but in that time in Kenya
there WAS no food available.

420
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,879
Now, you have to also consider
the mother.

421
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,559
If we'd gone in there and tried
to... to take the calf away,

422
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,159
it would have been absolute mayhem,
she'd have got incredibly stressed,

423
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,960
and that would probably have
jeopardised her survival.

424
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,799
In that particular situation,
when everything around us was dying,

425
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,718
there was absolutely nothing
we could do

426
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:51,000
to help that young elephant.

427
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,119
Although too late to save the calf,

428
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,480
a few months later,
the rains did finally return.

429
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,519
When we returned, it was amazing.
It was lush and green again.

430
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,359
And the elephants in the rains,
they all tend to come together,

431
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,119
so it was like all these groups
which had been dispersed,

432
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,399
which had been just somehow
coping on their own,

433
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,119
all got back together again,

434
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,320
so it was almost a sort of
festival type atmosphere.

435
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:27,960
GRUNTING

436
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,439
That was when, essentially,
they come together,

437
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,040
they mate and then, after that,
lots of young calves are being born.

438
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,879
Since the end of the drought,

439
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,079
over 220 calves
have been born in Amboseli,

440
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,960
and that number is still rising.

441
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,040
It's the biggest
elephant baby boom on record.

442
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,439
I think what's lovely to see
in that situation

443
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,719
is that having been through
such a terrible drought,

444
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,719
to see the way in which, you know,
if you let things alone,

445
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,080
you know, they do have
incredible capacity to bounce back.

446
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,759
Back in the mountains,
and several failed ascents later,

447
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,800
the team were still battling
through the whiteout.

448
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,160
They try one last time.

449
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,039
There's cloud below us
and cloud above us.

450
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,880
It somehow seems slightly
like we're heading nowhere slowly.

451
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,399
Then, as they reach the top,
finally, the clouds begin to part.

452
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,760
MUSIC: "Outro" by M83

453
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,400
? I am the king of my own land. ?

454
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,399
It was absolute magic here.

455
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,239
We've just come through
the densest, densest cloud,

456
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,279
having absolutely no idea
what's surrounding us.

457
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,079
The past few days have just been
rain and cloud and rain and cloud,

458
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,679
and, as if by magic,
there's the most spectacular view

459
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,519
of ice and glaciers and mountains,

460
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,999
that you just wouldn't think
was on the equator.

461
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,280
It's just amazing.

462
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,839
It's the most spectacular
mountain scenery I've seen,

463
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,720
and to think it's in Africa
is just mind-boggling.

464
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,599
These mysterious mountains have
finally unveiled their secrets,

465
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,279
and on the plains beyond,

466
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,880
the elephants have returned
to their home.

467
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,719
Despite having been explored
by film-makers for over a century,

468
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,920
East Africa still has the power
to enchant and surprise us all.

469
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,199
Next week, we go deep into
the tropical jungles of Africa...

470
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,720
RIPPING, GROWLING

471
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,000
...to see the rarest animals...

472
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,120
