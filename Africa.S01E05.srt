1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,480
North Africa.

2
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,159
High in Morocco's Atlas Mountains,

3
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,200
Barbary macaques shiver
in the icy cedars.

4
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,719
The ancestors of these monkeys
fled here

5
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,360
from a disaster that overwhelmed
their homeland.

6
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,159
Now, trapped in this isolated
corner of Africa,

7
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,560
there's no going back
to the land farther south.

8
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,959
Even in this snowy refuge,

9
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,120
there's a reminder

10
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:36,520
of what drove them here.

11
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,400
The unbridled power
of the African sun.

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,639
Under its intense gaze,

13
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
the snow can't last for long.

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,280
Melt water should bring life
to the lowlands.

15
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,760
Hundreds of torrents
cascade southwards.

16
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,760
But each is flowing
towards extinction.

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,679
Just 200 miles
south of the mountains,

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,120
the rivers are vaporised.

19
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,600
Life has been burnt off the land.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
This was the apocalypse from which
the Barbary macaques fled.

21
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,799
The sudden and unstoppable advance

22
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
of the greatest desert
on the planet.

23
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,560
The Sahara transformed North Africa.

24
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,079
Today, it covers an area

25
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,359
the size of the United States.

26
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,360
One-third of the entire
African continent.

27
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,320
This is one of the hottest places
on Earth.

28
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,199
The merciless sun,

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,439
a colossal 15-million-degree
nuclear reactor,

30
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,200
blasted life from the surface
of the land.

31
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,679
It still wreaks havoc.

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
A faint breath of wind
can be the beginning of disaster.

33
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,160
Nomads tell of entire
villages being engulfed...

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,759
...camel trains disappearing,

35
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,000
and people buried alive
inside their tents.

36
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,280
A sandstorm can be
1,000 miles across.

37
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,000
It seems miraculous that anything
can survive such devastation.

38
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,399
The Saharan apocalypse
wiped out many creatures,

39
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,159
but, today, some still cling on,

40
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,440
in the lands around the margins
of the great desert.

41
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,480
It's very dry here.

42
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,800
Some years, the rains fail entirely.

43
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,040
A lone Grevy's zebra.

44
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,079
He weighs close to half a tonne,

45
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,320
and could go for three days
without drinking.

46
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,159
Like the macaques,

47
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,480
his forebears were refugees
from the advancing Sahara.

48
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,560
The land is scrubby and dry.

49
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,800
But this stallion has claimed it
as his own.

50
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,560
He's been waiting months
for visitors.

51
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,560
Female visitors.

52
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,159
If they like his territory,

53
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,920
they might stay a while.

54
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,320
It's his first chance to mate
for a very long time.

55
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,759
HE BRAYS

56
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
Hardly a success.

57
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,000
Perhaps his visitors are looking
for a more impressive partner.

58
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,240
There's another setback.

59
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,079
The females were being followed,

60
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,559
a posse of young males,

61
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,480
every one, a rival.

62
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,800
It's time to separate
the men from the boys.

63
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,520
HE SNORTS

64
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
HE BRAYS

65
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
HE BRAYS

66
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,800
One by one,
the stallion sees them off.

67
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
HE BRAYS

68
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,080
The females had ringside seats.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,640
And his prowess has not gone
unnoted.

70
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
Machismo gives way to tenderness.

71
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,439
Around here, you have to take
every opportunity,

72
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,920
be it for food, for water
or for mates.

73
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,119
Female Grevy's are a fickle bunch.

74
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,320
The herd have decided to move on.

75
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,079
All of them.

76
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,439
HE NEIGHS

77
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,479
The stallion may never
see them again.

78
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,760
But there's a chance
that one is now carrying his foal.

79
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,320
In this harsh land
THAT must count as a triumph.

80
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,560
The sun's power cannot, however,
reach far underground.

81
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,919
Below, in stark contrast,

82
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,880
conditions are stable and tolerable.

83
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,800
And home to one of the planet's
strangest mammals.

84
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,760
Meet the naked mole rats.

85
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,240
These sabre-toothed sausages
wouldn't last a day in the desert.

86
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,159
Special filming tunnels
allow us to see

87
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,239
how well adapted they are
to the subterranean life.

88
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,199
They can run equally
well in both directions,

89
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,240
so tight space is no problem.

90
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,040
They have lost their fur.

91
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,679
And, most bizarrely,
they live in social colonies,

92
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,800
much like termites or ants.

93
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,319
After time spent digging,

94
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,680
the workers come together to relax.

95
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,520
But one here is very different
from all the rest.

96
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,720
Their queen.

97
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,839
Twice as heavy as her subjects,

98
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
and not afraid to throw
her weight around.

99
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,359
She is the mother of every
worker in the colony,

100
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
and exists in a near-continuous
state of pregnancy.

101
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,680
Even now, two dozen babies are
pulsating within her swollen belly.

102
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,239
Just occasionally,

103
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,840
one of her brood
is raised differently.

104
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,120
A daughter becomes a princess.

105
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,119
Until now, this youngster's enjoyed
a lazy, privileged life.

106
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,000
But not for much longer.

107
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,960
She has a destiny to fulfil.

108
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,960
The surface is a place where no
naked mole rat can survive for long.

109
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,280
But a princess will risk everything
to search for a partner.

110
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,080
The quest is urgent.

111
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,959
IT SNIFFS

112
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,760
There's an enticing smell
in the air.

113
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,680
A seductive scent draws her
downwards, to safety.

114
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
She's sniffed out a partner.

115
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,319
He too is alone,

116
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,040
and eager to start a new colony
in his lonely burrow.

117
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,999
Two months later,

118
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,359
the princess has become a queen.

119
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,720
And a new tyranny begins.

120
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,639
Tough though they are,

121
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,879
such refugees living on the edges
of North Africa

122
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,280
cannot survive in the heart
of the Sahara.

123
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,599
And yet here, in southern Nigeria,

124
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,239
there are creatures preparing
to journey right across the centre

125
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
of that great desert.

126
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,640
Barn swallows.

127
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,759
IT SINGS

128
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,240
They spent the winter roosting
in a forest of elephant grass.

129
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,000
But now, it's time
for them to leave.

130
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,760
All two million of them.

131
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,039
They're tiny, each weighing the same
as a couple of one pound coins,

132
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,239
yet the journey to their breeding
grounds in Europe

133
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,160
is over 3,000 miles long.

134
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,080
Ahead of them lies
a vast death trap.

135
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,639
The Sahara is too large
to go around.

136
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,080
The swallows have no choice
but to meet it head-on.

137
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,119
It will take one of nature's
greatest feats of navigation

138
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,480
to cross this lifeless wasteland.

139
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,039
A wilderness that stretches
not just to the horizon,

140
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,760
but almost beyond imagination.

141
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,480
It's an immense blank space
on the map.

142
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,799
In spite of the Sahara's reputation,

143
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,040
less than one-fifth of it is sand.

144
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,039
The rest is stone

145
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,840
and wind-scoured rock.

146
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,159
The sun not only bakes the land,

147
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,280
it warps its appearance.

148
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,679
The superheated air, rising
upward from the desert surface,

149
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,800
distorts the distant scene.

150
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,000
A reflection of the sky
shimmers on the sands - a mirage.

151
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,960
The sun is an illusionist.

152
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,599
To thirsty travellers,

153
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,319
a mirage can resemble a lake

154
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,160
which agonisingly recedes
as it's approached.

155
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,639
And swaying camels
coming to the rescue

156
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,360
transform into dry, spiny
acacia trees.

157
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,239
To cross this confused,
shimmering landscape,

158
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,080
many swallows will need to find
real water amongst the mirages.

159
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,399
Even in the Sahara,
rain does sometimes fall

160
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,759
and that is sufficient
for plants to survive

161
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,520
providing they have
the right adaptations.

162
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,919
Rising from the sand,

163
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,120
a dried-out ball of twigs.

164
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,160
In strong winds, it can travel.

165
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,720
This plant may have been dead
for 100 years.

166
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,639
Yet its name suggests
that all is not lost,

167
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,160
for this is a resurrection plant.

168
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,120
Around here, rain might only fall
once or twice a year.

169
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,479
But if you're searching for decades,

170
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,240
that might be enough.

171
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,559
Dead limbs absorb water

172
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,320
and unfurl in a matter of minutes.

173
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,600
But the resurrection plant
needs one more miracle.

174
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,560
THUNDER

175
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,959
Rain must fall on its branches

176
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,560
before they dry out
and close up again.

177
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,560
Within hours, shoots emerge.

178
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,799
In just a few weeks, they flower

179
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,880
and develop seeds of their own.

180
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,879
Then, before they can grow
any larger,

181
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,440
the sun kills them.

182
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,799
But their seeds live on,

183
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,879
ready for when the rains return,

184
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,840
even if that is a century from now.

185
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,639
North Africa wasn't always
so brutal.

186
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,919
Scattered across the Sahara
are glimpses of life

187
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,120
before the apocalypse
swept over the land.

188
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,199
In the north, a petrified forest...

189
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,039
trees turned to stone.

190
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,480
Remains from a far distant,
wetter past.

191
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,559
White sediments in the heart of the
Sahara are the dried-out remains

192
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,880
of what was once
the world's largest lake.

193
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,320
In the east, ruined cities
hark back to a time of plenty.

194
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,279
And here, deep inside Libya,

195
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,160
is Messak Settafet.

196
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,920
Carved here are hundreds of images
of animals, all drawn from life.

197
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
Ghosts from a greener time.

198
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,200
Remarkably, a remnant of this old
North Africa survives.

199
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,800
Bou-Hedma, in Tunisia,
is sustained by mountain rains.

200
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,199
It's a relic of the savannah

201
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,440
that once carpeted North Africa.

202
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,959
The vast grassland vanished

203
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,479
when a shift in the Earth's orbit
drove the rains south

204
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,479
and, in perhaps only
a matter of centuries,

205
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,400
the Sahara Desert overwhelmed
North Africa.

206
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,599
The evidence suggests this took
place around 6,000 years ago.

207
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,679
In evolutionary terms,
that's no time at all

208
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,880
and life has had little chance
to adapt to this new world.

209
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,920
Only a few tough specialists can
cope with life amongst the dunes.

210
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,760
THEY GRUNT

211
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,120
THEY GRUNT

212
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,039
Camels are sometimes called
"ships of the desert"

213
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,200
but, like the swallows,

214
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:57,760
they're really only visitors here.

215
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,399
These "ships" can certainly
cross the Sahara,

216
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,440
but even THEY can't make their home
in the harshest places.

217
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,079
Left to wander the desert
by themselves,

218
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,919
camels would not survive.

219
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,640
They depend on their human
navigators to find oases and wells.

220
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,199
Saharan folklore is full of tales
of caravans

221
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,400
that missed a well by a few hundred
metres and disappeared.

222
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,920
This is the White Desert, in Egypt.

223
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,559
The landscape is littered
with giant chalk pillars,

224
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,200
carved by innumerable sandstorms.

225
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,200
This glaring white oven
is lethally hot.

226
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,240
Food here is almost non-existent.

227
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,999
But there's a rare gift
from a passing camel.

228
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,720
The smell has lured dung beetles
from miles around.

229
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,920
For them, this is manna from heaven.

230
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,079
One dung ball could provide
enough food

231
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,400
to last this female beetle
the rest of her life.

232
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,040
But she has a problem.

233
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,520
To keep it fresh,

234
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,119
she must bury it in moist ground.

235
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,480
And that's not easy to find.

236
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,600
The temperature has already
risen ten degrees.

237
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,480
This lizard avoids
the roasting sand.

238
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,159
Only 30 centimetres
above the surface,

239
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,440
it's significantly cooler.

240
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,759
The 'reverse-pushing' technique

241
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,359
is certainly the fastest way

242
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,840
to keep the ball rolling.

243
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,800
But it does have one drawback.

244
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,680
You can't see where you're going.

245
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,800
Disaster!

246
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,760
Stuck between two dunes.

247
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,679
The dung ball is twice her weight,

248
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,800
but the urge to keep pushing
is inextinguishable.

249
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,919
Now, it's 41 degrees Celsius.

250
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,680
Soon, she'll be baked alive.

251
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,440
Her survival instinct, in the end,
over-rides her love for dung.

252
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,239
Much of the Sahara is uninhabitable,
but there are rare places

253
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,239
where there is
some possibility of survival.

254
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,560
Places where, by strange chance,
there is water.

255
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,080
Waw An Namus is an extinct volcano.

256
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,240
From space, it's a remote,
black scar on the Libyan Sahara.

257
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,999
Yet there are other colours here,

258
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,160
colours rarely seen
on the desert floor.

259
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,480
Blue and green.

260
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,439
Rain fell thousands of years ago,
when the Sahara was green

261
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,240
and percolated deep into the ground.

262
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,999
And here water from this vast,

263
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,200
ancient reservoir
rises to the surface.

264
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,320
These pools offer another
glimpse of the Sahara's past.

265
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,599
Wherever there's water
in North Africa,

266
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,200
living relics from this wetter time
have a chance to cling on.

267
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,440
This oasis is fed
by a hot volcanic spring.

268
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,119
Slightly away from the
stream of near-boiling water,

269
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,079
its cooler, and fish can live.

270
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,680
These are tilapia.

271
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,639
Hatchlings stick close
to their mother.

272
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,360
There are other dangers here
beside the scalding water.

273
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,040
Particularly at night.

274
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,280
The crocodiles are stealthy.

275
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,320
And the tilapia are almost blind
in the darkness.

276
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,600
In panic, they all leap to escape
the hunters' approach.

277
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,360
But this female
can't abandon her brood.

278
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,800
The crocodiles won't be thwarted.
They too can leap.

279
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,039
With first light, the crocodiles
lose the element of surprise,

280
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,520
and the battle is over, for now.

281
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,160
The mother fish has survived,
but where are her young?

282
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,079
All present and correct.

283
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,320
They spent the whole night
sheltering in her mouth.

284
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,560
The contest will be
repeated at sunset.

285
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,880
There is nowhere else to go.

286
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,879
Oases are always
sought by desert travellers,

287
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,320
but not all are as they seem.

288
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:31,600
This is the great Ubari Sand Sea,
in the heart of the Sahara.

289
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,599
These swallows have travelled
1,500 miles

290
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,520
since they left Nigeria.

291
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,399
Their superb powers of navigation
will eventually guide them

292
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,159
to Europe, but now they,
and other thirsty migrants,

293
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,960
need to find a speck of blue amidst
this ocean of sand.

294
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,159
And here it is.

295
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,400
Umm el Mar.

296
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,720
Here too, ancient groundwater
wells up to the surface.

297
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,239
But the birds need to be careful,

298
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,600
for the sun has played
a terrible trick.

299
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,440
This oasis is poisonous.

300
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,239
Intense evaporation over thousands
of years has left the water

301
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,400
saltier than the sea.

302
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,039
As if to underline the horror,

303
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,000
the place is infested
by vast swarms of flies.

304
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,760
But this plague
is a birds' salvation.

305
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,080
The flies are filled with
freshwater, filtered from the brine.

306
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,119
So, like a desert wanderer
squeezing a drink from a cactus,

307
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,000
the birds get all the water
they need from the flies' bodies.

308
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,560
More and more migrants join in.

309
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,000
Wagtails.

310
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,680
This is the birds' only stopover.

311
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,480
It gives them enough fuel to
escape from the Sahara and Africa.

312
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,239
Away from an oasis,

313
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,000
it seems remarkable
that anything can live at all.

314
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,560
The temperature of the sands
can exceed 70 degrees Celsius.

315
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,120
There's not the slightest
trace of water left at the surface.

316
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,200
And when that happens,
the Sahara itself cries out.

317
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,440
LOUD HUMMING

318
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,479
Billions of sliding grains
generate a hum

319
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,720
that echoes across miles
of empty desert.

320
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,640
These are the Sahara's legendary
singing dunes.

321
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,680
Over time, these avalanches add up.

322
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,079
If you watch the dunes
for long enough,

323
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,640
something remarkable is revealed.

324
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,480
One and a half years
flash past in a matter of seconds.

325
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,640
On this timescale,
the dunes are like a stormy sea.

326
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,040
An unstoppable tsunami of sand.

327
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,559
In this immense,
ever-shifting landscape,

328
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,799
it's easy to see how
a lost traveller could succumb

329
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,759
to what's been called
the Sahara's only endemic disease...

330
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,520
madness.

331
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,519
Can anything survive
the North African desert

332
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,360
when the sun is at its fiercest?

333
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,439
It's approaching mid-day.

334
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,680
A fringe-toed lizard is hungry.

335
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,080
He's on a stake-out.

336
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,600
Flashy scales
reflect some of the sun's rays.

337
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,080
Nevertheless,
the heat is almost unbearable.

338
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,400
His prey hasn't left home all day.

339
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,480
The lizard is the last animal
still out on the dunes.

340
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,600
But even he can't take it any more.

341
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,680
To survive longer,
you would need a spacesuit.

342
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,040
And in a way,
that's what these insects have.

343
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,279
Silver ants'
armoured skin reflects light.

344
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,040
They can tolerate temperatures that
would kill any other land animal.

345
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,799
Even so, they can only
survive for less than ten minutes

346
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,480
in the midday sun.

347
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,159
Time is precious.

348
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,880
The ants race to find food as soon
as their predators go to ground.

349
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,039
They can't afford to waste
a second getting lost,

350
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,320
so they spin to take
a bearing from the sun.

351
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,119
They log every change of direction,
every footstep,

352
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,880
in order to know exactly where
they are and where their nest lies.

353
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,959
Only four minutes to spare,

354
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,520
and they've found
a victim of heatstroke. A meal.

355
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,800
But it's going to take a
monumental effort to get it home.

356
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,919
Three minutes to go and they're
nearing their maximum temperature,

357
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,720
an astounding 53 degrees Celsius.

358
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,400
But there are already casualties.

359
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,919
One minute left,
and they're not going to make it.

360
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Something has to change.

361
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,039
The silver ant is the hardiest
of all desert inhabitants.

362
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,239
Even so, it can only survive
outside in the middle of the day

363
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,640
for a matter of minutes.

364
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,520
Now, the desert belongs to
the sun alone.

365
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,719
The sun has scorched
life from the Sahara.

366
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,199
And yet the vast desert it created
is a source of life

367
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,280
half a world away.

368
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:38,039
The advancing Sahara
vaporised the world's largest lake,

369
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,880
leaving behind the silvery remains
of countless microscopic algae.

370
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,599
In winter, the wind carries away
700,000 tonnes

371
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,760
of this mineral-rich dust every day.

372
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,199
It blows from here all the way
to South America,

373
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,400
where, astonishingly, it fertilises
the Amazon rainforest.

374
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,120
A striking demonstration of the
reach of this mighty continent.

375
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,839
Throughout its long history, Africa
has influenced the entire planet.

376
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,919
It was the cradle of a remarkable
array of land animals that spread

377
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,960
across the globe, and, of course, it
was the ancestral home of all of us.

378
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,279
This is the tale of two
of the Africa team's

379
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,920
most challenging desert expeditions.

380
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,240
One focused on a miniscule creature
with an incredible turn of speed.

381
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,520
The other, on a subject so slow, to
film it in action would take years.

382
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,359
In both cases,
the Sahara would push crews

383
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,400
to the limit in pursuit
of the perfect shot.

384
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,839
In Tunisia, the mission is to
capture footage of moving

385
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,359
sand dunes, something that's never
been tried like this before.

386
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,239
Because the dunes move so slowly,
we'll have to leave cameras here

387
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,280
for about 20 months,

388
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:04,960
which means there's a huge
potential for things to go wrong.

389
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,520
And with film-making, if something
can go wrong, it usually will.

390
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,039
Two local shepherds,
Amur and Nasser,

391
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,000
have volunteered to tend
the equipment full-time.

392
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,919
The camera tower will be
the tallest structure

393
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,040
for as far as the eye can see.

394
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,160
And there are three other cameras
at lower angles.

395
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,959
All this toil will yield
surprisingly scant results.

396
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,079
They've programmed the cameras
to take one photo every day.

397
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,879
That's only 365 photographs
a year...

398
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,399
which, when you run it at
normal speed, just over 14 seconds.

399
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,359
I think it's taken longer to explain
what's going to happen

400
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,919
than the end result
will actually be.

401
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,800
The cameras are left to
the mercy of the sun, wind and sand.

402
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,040
In the meantime, crews are shooting
all across North Africa.

403
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,719
In Egypt, the challenge is to
get into the world of the most

404
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,479
heat-tolerant desert animal,
the silver ant.

405
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,399
They're really small,
they're really fast.

406
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,080
Like, you're not too sure
if you've seen an ant.

407
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,960
The crew have three weeks to gather
the footage they need.

408
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,119
We're going to try
a tracking shot on this ant nest.

409
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,439
Moving forward towards it,

410
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,839
as the ants pour out of the hole
in their millions.

411
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,839
Not only are these insects
super-fast,

412
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,439
they also keep antisocial hours.

413
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,839
The thing is,

414
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,479
we need to be out here in the middle
of the day to film these ants.

415
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,839
They don't do what they do
when it's nice and cool at seven,

416
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,999
eight o'clock in the morning.

417
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,159
I can't remember ever being
in a place where the wind was

418
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,960
so relentless
and the temperatures were so high.

419
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,639
The insufferable heat
is not the only problem.

420
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,679
Dangers are everywhere.

421
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,119
Ooh!

422
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,519
There's a really fat scorpion,
it's really big!

423
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,040
One, two, three.

424
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,280
This might kill.

425
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:27,359
Yeah? Yeah.

426
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,719
It's big and they have a lot
of poison in his dark thing.

427
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,879
What, that thing there?

428
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,279
Don't! Oh, my god!

429
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,719
Don't touch it!

430
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,599
The scorpion will be released far,
far away from the camp,

431
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,319
in a shady spot.

432
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,359
No such luck for the team.

433
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,999
They're back
to work in the midday sun.

434
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,439
This is, this is too much.
This is crazy.

435
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,879
This is crazy.

436
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,959
Indeed.

437
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,000
The heat seems to have given Kat and
Warwick a touch of Saharan madness.

438
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,959
The plan is to do an experiment,

439
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,599
to find out how fast
these little ants can run.

440
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:13,479
So we're going to lay this along
the floor, and hopefully an ant will

441
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,759
run alongside it and we can film it
at high speed.

442
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,079
And from that, calculate their...
their speed,

443
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,399
and perhaps try and relate it to
how fast that would be for a human.

444
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,639
Like me.

445
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,079
Silver ants are expert navigators,

446
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,599
using the angle of the sun
to calculate their position.

447
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,719
But for our team, even basic mental
tasks are becoming a challenge.

448
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,119
Count the seconds. See one running
and then count the seconds.

449
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,480
It's difficult to count a second,
isn't it? No, it's "one".

450
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,680
"One", yeah!

451
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,680
There he goes!

452
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,399
He's gone ten centimetres
in four seconds,

453
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,799
but we're running
at 500 frames a second,

454
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,599
which is 20 times normal time.

455
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,880
Yeah. So in fact, he's
covered those ten centimetres in...

456
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,999
We know that he does
half a metre in one second.

457
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,439
Half a metre per second, yep.

458
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,239
50 centimetres in one second,
roughly. Yeah.

459
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,040
So, how many body lengths is that?

460
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,439
He's maybe doing
five body lengths a second,

461
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,039
if he's two metres tall like I am.

462
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,400
Are you? Yeah. That's how much more
than a normal man I am.

463
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,319
Eventually, the duo decide that
if the silver ants were our size,

464
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,160
they'd be doing 280 miles an hour.

465
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,599
They're one of the fastest sprinters
in the animal kingdom.

466
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,279
No wonder we've been
struggling to film them.

467
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,920
It does explain a few things.

468
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,960
Ant-letics!

469
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,119
Knowing the exact speed of the ants
is all well and good, but there's

470
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,680
still a great deal of work to be
done before the shoot finishes.

471
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,319
However, in Tunisia, there's
no shortage of time, and hopefully,

472
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,680
no news is good news, as far as
Amur and Nasser are concerned.

473
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,799
The final week in Egypt,

474
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,200
and the crew seem to be adapting
to life in the oven.

475
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,680
Practice is making perfect,
and the sequence is coming together.

476
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,119
I think we've got some lovely shots.

477
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,599
Every single shot
has been really hard-earned.

478
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,879
But getting down in the ant's world
is now taking its toll on the kit.

479
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,559
It's running to stand still,

480
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,240
the business of blowing
dust off these things.

481
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,479
Oh, no!

482
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,319
It's got dust in it!

483
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,519
CRUNCH

484
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,080
Ooh, crunch.

485
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,759
I think these ants
are stunning looking.

486
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,719
Near-impossible to film, I think,
because of the speed they had.

487
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,520
But, you know, I've come to love them
over the days and weeks.

488
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,199
With the sequence in the bag,

489
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,800
Warwick wants the final
traditional sunset shot.

490
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,200
It's the best time of day
to film sunsets, in the evening.

491
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,879
That's experience
that tells me that.

492
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,719
I've been doing this for years.
You learn these things.

493
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,279
Thanks to Warwick's experience,
including sunsets, he and Kat

494
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,280
have captured the extraordinary life
of the speedy silver ant.

495
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,839
Over a year later, in Tunisia,

496
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,440
it's time to take down
the sand dune cameras.

497
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,599
Bonjour!

498
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,879
Nasser, Amur. Hello again.

499
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,720
So how's it been, has it been good?

500
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:10,959
It's OK, but two days ago, we have
a little bit... small problem.

501
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,759
After surviving 600 days
in the desert,

502
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,880
the "small problem" is that
the cameras have been vandalised.

503
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,359
I'm really hot and bothered now,
it's 40 degrees,

504
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,279
and someone's smashed the cameras.

505
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,000
Not been a good start to the day,
to be honest.

506
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,559
There's no doubt the dunes
have moved.

507
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,240
But the question is
whether the equipment has survived.

508
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,599
That is amazing,
the camera's still here.

509
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,199
I guess maybe it just took them so long
to get through the toughened plastic,

510
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,919
that they felt they had made so much noise
they were worried about the guards coming,

511
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,639
because they only sleep
a couple of 100 metres away.

512
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,680
After almost two years of waiting,
it's the moment of truth.

513
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,319
We're going to find out,
find out whether or not

514
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,199
the cameras
have actually recorded anything.

515
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,920
It's just hugely stressful
because it's never been done before.

516
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,999
The footage is a surreal window
into a secret world...

517
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,760
the private life of a sand dune.

518
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,479
The Africa team
struggled under the burning sun

519
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,280
and driving winds
that are hallmarks of the Sahara.

520
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,119
They went home with an enormous
admiration for the creatures that

521
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,520
spend their entire lives battling to
survive in this brutal desert world.

522
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,039
Next time, we'll be looking towards
the future of Africa

523
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,839
and its wildlife.

524
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,879
Meeting the remarkable Elvis
and his highly endangered family.

525
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,080
Diving with Sheila,
who's learning to swim again.

526
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,839
Africa's wildlife
is at a critical point

527
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,200
as it faces its greatest threat.

528
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,279
As this battle between man

529
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,360
and wildlife happens, in most cases,
wildlife is on the losing end.

530
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,039
But there is hope as the
new generation takes on the task

531
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,959
of protecting Africa's animals
for the 21st century and beyond.

532
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,080
Join me
next time for the future of Africa.

533
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,400
