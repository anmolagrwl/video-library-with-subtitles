1
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,900
The Cape of Good Hope,
on Africa's southerly tip.

2
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,379
Here, two great seas meet.
One, the warm Indian Ocean,

3
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,660
the other, the chilly Atlantic.

4
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,419
And as they mingle,
so they create a billowing cloak

5
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,180
that drapes the summit
of Table Mountain.

6
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,219
Spectacular though this is,
the mountain's cloudy covering

7
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,019
is only a hint of the
profound influence

8
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,340
that these two very different oceans
have on the fortunes of life here.

9
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,059
And not just here at the Cape,

10
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,140
but across the length and breadth
of southern Africa.

11
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,139
Two thousand miles
north from the Cape,

12
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,580
beneath this sandy beach,
new life is stirring.

13
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,979
Hundreds of baby green turtles

14
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,340
emerge like a torrent from
the safety of their nest.

15
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,739
Each one, just seven
centimetres long,

16
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,660
must make a hundred-metre
sprint down the beach.

17
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,620
From the moment they hatch,

18
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:59,220
they're driven by an instinctive
urge to run to the sea.

19
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,299
Few creatures start life with
the odds for success

20
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,180
so heavily stacked against them.

21
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,340
Yellow-billed kites.

22
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,460
Pied crows.

23
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,819
But so many of these hatchlings
appear together,

24
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,980
that predators can't catch them all.

25
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,580
Last out,
this baby might seem doomed.

26
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,380
But struggling out late could just
give her a chance.

27
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,100
The crows seem insatiable.

28
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,580
Even those that reach
the sea aren't safe.

29
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,260
This female has to make a dash
for it.

30
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,420
She's still in danger,
and not just from above.

31
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,339
A ghost crab may be smaller
than the hatchling,

32
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,900
but it has the strength to drag
her into its lair.

33
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,260
Not this time.

34
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,700
At last, the sea.

35
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,379
She has to catch a breath
if she's not to drown,

36
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,620
but the pounding waves make it
desperately difficult.

37
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,300
Beyond the surf, calmer water,

38
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,260
but even here, the hatchling
is not out of danger.

39
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,580
She dives.

40
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,580
Just in time.

41
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,460
Only one hatchling in a thousand
will survive to adulthood,

42
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,580
but if she does,
she may live for 80 years.

43
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,220
For now,
the ocean is there to be explored.

44
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,939
As the hatchling
disappears into the deep blue,

45
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,939
she swims into the waters of one
the planet's most powerful currents.

46
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,100
The Agulhas.

47
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,859
The Agulhas sweeps south
towards the Cape,

48
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,900
transporting a hundred billion
gallons of warm water every day.

49
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,460
These tropical seas are so warm,
they evaporate on an enormous scale.

50
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,739
Water vapour rises until,
at altitude,

51
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,620
it cools and condenses into clouds.

52
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,859
As the clouds drift inland,

53
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,500
they bring rain to one of the least-
explored corners of our planet.

54
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,540
The mountains of Mozambique.

55
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,700
THUNDERCLAP

56
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,580
This the wettest place
in southern Africa.

57
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,979
Decades of civil war have
kept travellers away

58
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,540
from this little-known land.

59
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,739
It was satellite mapping that
revealed the full extent

60
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,259
of the forest that grows here,

61
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,380
so now it's known to outsiders
as the Google rainforest.

62
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
It could also be called
the butterfly forest.

63
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,979
After the rains, butterflies have
emerged together in huge numbers.

64
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,100
As soon as their wings dry out,
they will take to the air.

65
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,740
Their goal? To find a mate.

66
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,980
But how?

67
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,379
There may be thousands close by,
but the foliage is so thick,

68
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,540
it's difficult for them
to find each other.

69
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
They have a remarkable solution.

70
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,220
They follow rivers upstream
and travel to higher ground.

71
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,620
The journey can take
hours of determined flying.

72
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,500
Eventually they emerge into the only
open space there is.

73
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,700
The treeless peak of Mount Mabu.

74
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,579
Up here, free from the confines
of the forest,

75
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,900
they hold a butterfly ball.

76
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,779
Now the butterflies have
all the space they need

77
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,500
for their aerobatic courtship.

78
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,579
The male's strategy is simple.

79
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,099
Fly higher and faster
than the competition,

80
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,460
and just maybe you'll
win a virgin female.

81
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,419
This spectacular gathering,
unseen by outsiders until now,

82
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,059
happens for just half an hour
each morning

83
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,020
and for just a few weeks
in the year.

84
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,220
Once mated, the females descend back
to the rainforest to lay their eggs.

85
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,259
A forest that only exists
because of moisture rising

86
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,099
from the warm Agulhas current

87
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,140
hundreds of miles away
in the Indian Ocean.

88
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,979
The rainwater now flows southwards
from Mozambique's highest peaks

89
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,420
to the lowlands of the Eastern Cape.

90
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,179
And where the land flattens,
rivers slow,

91
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,380
creating a vast swamp
50 miles across.

92
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,260
This is Gorongosa.

93
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,500
Here, all kinds of creatures
come to catch fish.

94
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,019
Whiskered catfish work as a team.

95
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,179
They take a gulp of air
at the surface

96
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,100
and then belch it out underwater
to create a net of bubbles.

97
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,940
And that traps little fish.

98
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,980
There are fish for everyone.

99
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,260
And each species has its own
technique for catching them.

100
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,459
It's all very well
having a big beak,

101
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,500
but you've still got
to know how to use it.

102
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,260
This young pelican
has a lot to learn...

103
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,580
...and not long to do so.

104
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,820
Maybe, like the catfish,
teamwork is the answer.

105
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,139
It's certainly working
for the flock,

106
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,700
and this pelican seems to be
getting the hang of it.

107
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,980
But surely it can't swallow
that catfish?

108
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Trying to was a mistake.

109
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,939
The rainwater,
briefly held in Gorongosa's swamp,

110
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,180
has now been enriched
with silt and sand.

111
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,579
All down this coast, sediment-laden
rivers - the Zambezi, the Limpopo,

112
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,100
the Save - drain back to the sea,

113
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,500
and there they meet
the Agulhas current.

114
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,660
And what happens to all that sand?

115
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,939
Over the millennia,
the Agulhas has worked it

116
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,580
into a complex underwater landscape.

117
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,819
This vast sand sculpture is
the Bazaruto Archipelago,

118
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,940
the oldest of its kind in the world.

119
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,980
It may look like paradise,
but living here is not easy.

120
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,899
For 100,000 years, the Agulhas
Current has battered

121
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,820
these submerged dunes
with underwater sandstorms.

122
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,179
But where the water is deep enough
to escape these storms,

123
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,540
nutrients carried from Africa's
interior fuel an explosion of life.

124
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,380
A rare oceanic hunter rules here.

125
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,820
Giant Kingfish.

126
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,219
As big as a man,
and weight for weight,

127
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,380
one of the most powerful fish
in the sea.

128
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,020
Despite their size, they're
extraordinarily agile when hunting.

129
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,459
Normally kingfish are solitary,

130
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,859
but for just a few weeks each year,
they gather at places

131
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,900
like Bazaruto and prepare
for an extraordinary journey.

132
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,180
One that will take them far inland.

133
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,660
The Mtentu River.

134
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,300
A king of kingfish
leads them upstream.

135
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,739
As they travel
further into fresh water,

136
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,020
they seem to change from aggressive
hunters into dedicated pilgrims.

137
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,819
Now,
many miles from their natural home,

138
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,660
and in response to an unknown cue,
they stop and begin to circle.

139
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,979
Other marine fish that migrate
upriver usually do so in order

140
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,180
to breed, but there's no evidence
that these kingfish spawn up here.

141
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,140
Neither do they hunt.
So what are they doing?

142
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,620
In truth, the purpose of this
strange behaviour is still unknown.

143
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,699
Within a few weeks,

144
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,140
they will retrace their journey back
to the ocean.

145
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,619
The lives of kingfish, like those
of turtles and butterflies

146
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,340
and pelicans, are influenced
by the Agulhas Current.

147
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,420
But that influence can only reach
so far.

148
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,220
And this is why.

149
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,700
The Drakensberg mountains.

150
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,259
Here, local people say that the
vultures soar so high,

151
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,260
they can see into the future.

152
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,779
These sheer cliffs,
rising to over 3,000 metres,

153
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,059
hold back the advancing rain clouds

154
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,340
and, as a result, the land beyond
them is starved of water.

155
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,540
This is the greatest
expanse of sand in the world.

156
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,579
A seemingly-endless desert

157
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,140
that is the vast parched
centre of Southern Africa.

158
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,219
Thousands of miles to the west,

159
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,620
where this desert meets the Atlantic
Ocean, another current prevails.

160
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,179
But the Benguela Current,
surging up the west side of Africa,

161
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
has a very different character.

162
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,139
It's extremely cold,
full of nutrients

163
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,980
and it's thronged with life.

164
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,020
A great white shark.

165
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,140
They can raise their body
temperature to 10 degrees

166
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:07,620
above that
of the surrounding sea.

167
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,220
But doing so requires an enormous
amount of high-grade fuel.

168
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,660
So this is a great bonanza
for them - the body of a dead whale.

169
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,140
The carcass will draw in every great
white for miles around.

170
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,700
And here, off Cape Town,
that means a lot of sharks.

171
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,619
Instead of feeding in a frenzy,

172
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,500
these sharks have rather refined
table manners.

173
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,060
They swim side-by-side to get
the measure of each other.

174
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,740
Then each takes its turn.

175
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,740
This female is the biggest,
so she eats first.

176
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,100
The next only feeds
when she gives way.

177
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,099
The waters of the Benguela
are so rich,

178
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,940
they support more great white sharks
than any other seas on the planet.

179
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,619
And they are so cold,

180
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,220
they attract some surprising
creatures to these African shores.

181
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,460
Penguins.

182
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,620
African penguins.

183
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,700
This female is returning
to relieve her partner.

184
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,059
Of course there's no ice here,

185
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,500
but these rocks can be
almost as slippery.

186
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,339
But there are more serious obstacles

187
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,580
than the slippery rocks
awaiting them.

188
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,580
It's his turn to feed, so he leaves
her to look after their eggs.

189
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,859
Now she must tackle a problem
faced by no other kind of penguin.

190
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,699
For the next 10 days,
she must protect her eggs

191
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,820
from the African sun.

192
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,779
A dense coat of feathers

193
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,860
that keeps her warm in cold seas
now stifles her.

194
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,819
On these exposed rocks,

195
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,940
she must shade her eggs
instead of keeping them warm.

196
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,860
Everything here seems
the wrong way round.

197
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,740
For some, the soaring
temperature is too much.

198
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,780
A neighbour deserts his nest.

199
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,100
His egg will not survive.

200
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
He's not the only one to give up.

201
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,860
Some years,
not a single chick is reared.

202
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,459
Penguins are adapted

203
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,579
to withstand temperatures
of 40 degrees below zero,

204
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,540
not 40 degrees above.

205
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,459
Now, at the hottest part of the day,
the very worst time,

206
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,940
her chicks are hatching.

207
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:09,300
Just when they need her most, she's
reaching the limit of her endurance.

208
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,859
After 10 days of intensive fishing,

209
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,460
the chicks' father comes back
to take his turn at the nest.

210
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,100
But will he be too late?

211
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,180
He greets his young for the very
first time.

212
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,419
The coolness of the Benguela Current
brought the penguins here

213
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,539
but that very coolness
is a great disadvantage,

214
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,620
because it generates little rain.

215
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,420
It can, however, produce
moisture in a different form.

216
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,539
A thick blanket of fog
rolls in from the sea

217
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,300
and condenses on this thirsty land.

218
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,100
And each year, the desert bursts
into life with a dazzling display.

219
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,459
Water is so scarce that this
show will not last long,

220
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,020
so plants compete to attract
their pollinators with colour.

221
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,499
Here in Namaqualand,
a 600-mile strip of coastal desert

222
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,900
becomes carpeted with blooms.

223
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,619
The morning sun opens
a Namaqua daisy,

224
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,420
and reveals a male monkey beetle
asleep inside.

225
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,539
Nights here are so cold that monkey
beetles shelter within

226
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,620
the closed-up petals of the daisies.

227
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,699
The habit brings benefits
to both sides.

228
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,180
The beetle is kept warm
and the flower gets pollinated.

229
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,260
But now the beetle has urgent
business. He must find a mate.

230
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,140
As he searches, he hops from bloom
to bloom, pollinating each in turn.

231
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,100
At last he spots a potential mate.

232
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,900
A golden princess.

233
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,740
But here comes trouble.

234
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,980
A rival.

235
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,620
There's no time for introductions.

236
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,580
But he's been too slow.

237
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,820
The rivals immediately
begin to brawl.

238
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,379
The female will only mate inside the
daisy,

239
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,140
so they wrestle for possession.

240
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,780
They're so engrossed in fighting,
they've pushed her off.

241
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,340
The challenger is ejected.

242
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,220
The winner wastes no time
before getting back to business.

243
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,380
At last!

244
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,259
Now there will be a new
generation of monkey beetles

245
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,980
to pollinate these
Namaqualand flowers.

246
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,539
For most of the year this land
is desperately dry,

247
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,539
but just occasionally,

248
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,300
brief, violent storms
sweep in from the cold ocean.

249
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,739
Springbok have been roaming
this desert for many months,

250
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,980
searching for one of these rare
and highly localised downpours.

251
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,580
The grass is sprouting.

252
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,180
And that is worth celebrating!

253
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,340
If you're a springbok,
that means pronking.

254
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:20,540
MUSIC: "Waltz of the Flowers"
by Tchaikovsky.

255
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,940
We still don't know exactly why
they do this.

256
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,660
The simplest answer is that
they're dancing for joy.

257
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,980
Africa's most southerly tip.

258
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,299
This is where the two great ocean
currents, the warm Agulhas

259
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,380
and the cold Benguela,
crash into one another.

260
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,780
And this collision, in itself,
draws in life in abundance.

261
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:31,580
A super-pod of hunting dolphins,
5,000 strong.

262
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,860
And shadowing them...

263
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,780
...Africa's biggest predator.

264
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,340
A Bryde's whale.

265
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,659
This female is 15 metres long

266
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,900
and weighs more than a whole
family of elephants.

267
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,459
The dolphins are in pursuit
of sardines...

268
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,140
millions of them.

269
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,259
But these cold-water fish
are heading towards an impenetrable

270
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,820
barrier of warm water that they will
not cross, the Agulhas Current.

271
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,460
They're trapped.

272
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,700
And that gives the whale her chance.

273
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,299
But the sardines are so speedy

274
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,380
that the whale only catches a few
with each pass.

275
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,860
More and more hunters arrive.

276
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,419
The whale needs the other hunters
to push the fish upwards,

277
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,300
forcing them against the surface.

278
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,740
Now they have nowhere to escape.

279
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,179
With each lumbering turn
she loses precious time,

280
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,660
time that favours the more nimble.

281
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,779
The Bryde's whale probably knows

282
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,020
that this opportunity will last less
than five minutes.

283
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,020
And with the last
few lunges, she finally cashes in.

284
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,299
The forces that triggered
this great event

285
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,779
have also shaped the fortunes
of life

286
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,700
far beyond this particular
battleground.

287
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,620
Without these currents,
Southern Africa would be a desert.

288
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,899
But combined, the very different
powers of the Agulhas

289
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,539
and the Benguela have transformed
the Cape

290
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,620
into a land where life can flourish.

291
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,539
The Comoro Islands
off Africa's east coast

292
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,900
are a haven for green turtles.

293
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,259
Every year, a million turtles
hatch on these beaches,

294
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,780
but the chances of any one of them
surviving is tiny.

295
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,819
The Africa team came here to try
and capture the dramatic

296
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,660
first few minutes in the lives
of these baby turtles.

297
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,540
It was to be both a technical, and
surprisingly emotional challenge.

298
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,299
It's only when you get down on the
eye level of the baby turtle

299
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,099
that you realise what an enormous
journey it's got to make

300
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,500
down over the beach, and it really
is quite epic.

301
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,979
That's fine.
Oh, yeah, that's lovely.

302
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,939
It's using all these complicated,
heavy bits of equipment

303
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,579
which hopefully will enable us

304
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,820
to get into the world of a turtle
which is just a few inches long.

305
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,939
As they break out of all the soft
sand, they hit the hard sand

306
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,060
and that's where the real
sprint takes place.

307
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,338
They must be desperate to hit that
water,

308
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:08,618
because you can see the sea's
just over the horizon.

309
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:10,220
We're following them
all the way down

310
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:12,900
and you do kind of get involved
with them and cheering them on.

311
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,660
OK, slow down a bit. Slow down.

312
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,779
And suddenly all these crows
come flocking in

313
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,860
and start picking them off and you
just think, that's just so unfair.

314
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,420
Lots more coming in.
Just loads coming in now.

315
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,098
I do, God, I feel for them.

316
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,698
You know it's really quite upsetting

317
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:42,140
and particularly when you're
looking through the camera

318
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:44,899
and I'm just filling frame with
a turtle running down the beach,

319
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,140
then suddenly from nowhere, a beak
comes in and whoosh, that's it.

320
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,860
That turtle's no more.

321
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,339
The turtles that escape the perils
of the beach

322
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,940
still have to face pounding surf.

323
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,700
But, at last, they're
in their element.

324
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,379
More than can be said for the crew.

325
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,779
They're faster than you,
aren't they? Yep.

326
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,220
It's a bit embarrassing.

327
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,740
Beaten by something
that's less than a day old.

328
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,819
When you see hatchlings
get off the beach

329
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,420
and going in the white water, you'd
think they'd just get obliterated.

330
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,179
They just punch through the water -
they do get flung around

331
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,979
but then they just right themselves,
keep on swimming and they're

332
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,420
ahead of you, coming out the back
of the wave and it's amazing.

333
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,779
You're seeing all these baby turtles
getting picked off,

334
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,220
left, right and centre,
but they just keep going.

335
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,980
They are just so resilient.

336
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,980
And that made what happened next
so distressing.

337
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,460
A particularly high spring tide
flooded the beach.

338
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,180
Any baby turtles still in their
nests would be lucky to survive.

339
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,540
See it bubbling out as well.
Yeah. See the air.

340
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,459
Well, it means that basically
anything below

341
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,778
that line's going to be gone.

342
00:51:31,779 --> 00:51:33,340
Let's hope and pray it's not, but...

343
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,660
As you say, we don't know,
let's wait and see.

344
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,860
All across the world,
turtles are in decline.

345
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,499
Their eggs are stolen,

346
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,739
the adults are hunted
for their flesh

347
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,540
and they drown in fishing nets.

348
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,420
But here in the Comoros,
they have friends.

349
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,179
It's amazing here in Itsamia.

350
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,019
It's just a really heartening
story of how the local people

351
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,979
are doing everything
they can to protect sort of

352
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,260
what they think of as their turtles.

353
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,460
And some of the baby turtles
have survived the flood tide.

354
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,020
The whole village
comes to help the hatchlings.

355
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,339
But the most important effort is to
protect

356
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,860
the adults from outsiders who would
hunt them for their meat.

357
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,899
They've taken it upon themselves
to really police the beaches

358
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,660
around here and make sure that
poaching is kept to a minimum.

359
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,179
The selfless protection these people
provide means that this is

360
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,819
one of the few places in the world
where turtle numbers

361
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,820
are actually increasing.

362
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,499
And remarkably, here in Itsamia,
the population has in fact

363
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,540
doubled in the last decade.

364
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,379
As the shoot was coming to the end,

365
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,339
cameraman Kevin Flay noticed
that some of the turtles

366
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,580
that made it through the surf
faced one last danger.

367
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,939
I'm getting shots of a kite
which is flying down

368
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,499
and taking turtles off the water
surface.

369
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,820
That was a part of the story
we had to tell.

370
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:00,099
The aim is for us to be underwater,

371
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,339
looking straight up as this happens,

372
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,780
and that's actually
really quite hard.

373
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,860
OK. Three, two, one...

374
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,500
Undeterred,
the crew got into position.

375
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,700
There we go, the kite's up.

376
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,939
You can't see where you're going
because my head's glued

377
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,099
to this viewfinder, so I'm banging
into rocks and things like that.

378
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,900
I'm really just trying to keep
the turtle in shot.

379
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,619
Something came in then.

380
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,939
She came in and swooped down
over the water's surface.

381
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,578
And you could see
the kite from underwater?

382
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,218
I could see it,
I could see the shape.

383
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:14,740
In frame and you were running?
Yep.

384
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,699
Didn't take the turtle.
Didn't take the turtle.

385
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,180
Probably that's the best of both
worlds, because we got

386
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:25,980
our lovely underwater shot of a kite
and the turtle gets away!

387
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,300
This lucky hatchling
isn't the only one.

388
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,299
With the help of the village
of Itsamia, thousands more

389
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,660
have a chance to make it
to the open ocean.

390
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,019
It's only really local populations
that can actually support

391
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,700
and sustain this conservation work.

392
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:48,779
If it comes from the roots upwards,
then it's got a chance of success.

393
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,459
You know, I think it's amazing,
I really do, the fact that they

394
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,300
do this and you know we should see
it more often around the world.

395
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,739
It's hard not to admire these
extraordinary little creatures

396
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,300
as they battle against such odds.

397
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,619
This baby turtle
won't touch land again

398
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,580
until she returns to the very same
island to lay her own eggs.

399
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,299
With luck, she'll find the beach
is still protected

400
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,660
by the people of Itsamia.

401
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,620
Next time, the vast cauldron
of the Sahara Desert.

402
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,059
This colossal wilderness

403
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,020
covers one-third of the entire
African continent.

404
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,700
To survive here, life is stretched
to its very limits.

405
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,340
Simply being tough isn't enough.

406
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,380
Only the most extraordinary
creatures will triumph.

407
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,700
