1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
The very centre of Africa.

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,080
And the centre of two million square
miles of dense tropical rain forest.

3
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,359
At first glance it seems deserted
and eerily still,

4
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,200
not an easy place to live.

5
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,680
MONKEY CHATTERS

6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,159
But in fact, there is a greater
concentration of animals here

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,760
than anywhere else in Africa.

8
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,040
And in this world,
they must grab every opportunity.

9
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,159
Competition is intense
and unrelenting.

10
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,680
TREE CREAKS

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,639
Even the forest itself
fights its corner with spines

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
and poisonous sap.

13
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,800
Here, every living thing must
fight for its space.

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
Such beauty.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,319
But the flower is self-serving,

16
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,119
enticing animals
into an unwitting alliance.

17
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,039
Stingless bees.

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,199
They have to work hard.

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,079
The forest flowers make them do so
by rationing their nectar,

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,239
forcing each bee to visit
and so pollinate

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,160
at least a thousand blooms each day.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,839
For the bees, it's worth the effort.

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,359
They need the nectar to make honey,
which they store in pots.

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,360
It's so precious, they keep it
hidden beneath the bark of a tree.

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,359
But their secret is out.

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
MONKEY HOWLS

27
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,800
Nothing is safe in this forest.

28
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,480
Chimpanzees love honey.

29
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,399
She seems oblivious to danger.

30
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,040
A fall from up here could be fatal.

31
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,560
But she does need a bigger stick.

32
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,919
Only a chimp has the ability to
break into a stingless bees'

33
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,120
nest as well hidden as this.

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,839
Chimps are extremely intelligent,

35
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,240
but none is born with
the skill to use a tool.

36
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,000
Youngsters like this one
must learn by watching.

37
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,879
She uses special tools,
one after another,

38
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,119
to get all the honey she can,

39
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,240
and in a few minutes, she destroys
what took the bees years to build.

40
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,960
In the rainforest, nothing is safe.

41
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,639
MONKEY HOWLS

42
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,959
Here in the Congo,

43
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,519
there can be as many as 500 trees
crammed into every acre.

44
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,839
In the battle for space,

45
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,960
some will rise to over 60 metres
high in just a few decades.

46
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,279
In a valley like this,

47
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,040
there could be close on 1,000
different species of tree.

48
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,679
Up here, the crowns barely touch.

49
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,160
Each tree seems to
respect its neighbour's space.

50
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,159
When they germinate down on
the forest floor, young trees

51
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,640
and plants are less restrained.

52
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,399
But every new generation
fights it out,

53
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,600
in battles we can
see by accelerating time.

54
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,439
They must get light if they are to
survive and they squeeze,

55
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,880
crush and even slash one
another in order to reach it.

56
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,319
Despite the thick canopy above,
some sunlight does filter through

57
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,119
and allows a few low-light
specialists

58
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
to bloom near the forest floor.

59
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,880
Down here there are animals, too,
that seek out the sunlight.

60
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,560
The forest's largest predator.

61
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
A female rock python.

62
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,719
Her body is five metres long, weighs
100 kilos and has 4,000 muscles

63
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,040
that she uses to crush the life
out of her victims.

64
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,600
But right now, her need is
not for food. It's for warmth.

65
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,839
She finds a rare patch where a shaft
of sunlight strikes the ground

66
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,680
and she begins to bask.

67
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,359
She's cold-blooded,

68
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,080
so this is the only way she can
raise the temperature of her body.

69
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,919
But now she's becoming very
warm indeed,

70
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,839
more than ten degrees hotter
than usual.

71
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,000
At 40 degrees centigrade,
she's in danger of killing herself.

72
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Just in time, she moves off.

73
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,200
She disappears below ground.

74
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,840
This is her nest
and it's full of giant eggs.

75
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,799
It's critical for the eggs
development

76
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,400
that they stay above 30 degrees.

77
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,479
Here in this special filming burrow,
she gently wraps her super-heated

78
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,920
body around the eggs, passing
onto them the warmth of the sun.

79
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,080
She has done this every
day for three months.

80
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,559
The repeated heat stress on her body
is so great it could be lethal,

81
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,319
and at the very least, it will take
three years for her to

82
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
recover from incubating this one
clutch of eggs.

83
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,359
Her parchment-shelled eggs carry
the pressed imprint of her scales...

84
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,480
an indication of the strength
of her embrace.

85
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
At last, her efforts are rewarded.

86
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,079
But the babies can't stay here.
They must leave their sanctuary

87
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,600
and find food in the tangled
world above.

88
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,919
They're over 60 centimetres long,
already big enough to be

89
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,000
a threat to the smaller
inhabitants of the forest.

90
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
But they are themselves vulnerable.

91
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Particularly to other snakes.

92
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,239
But this one is their mother.

93
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,959
Unusually for snakes,

94
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,880
her maternal instincts continue
for days after her eggs hatch.

95
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,679
Even so, the forest is such
a dangerous place that only

96
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,600
one in 100 of her youngsters
is likely to reach adulthood.

97
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,880
Just occasionally, ,
the competition eases.

98
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
A tree suddenly produces fruit.

99
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,039
It's a magnet for the creatures
of the canopy, and they, in turn,

100
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,800
as they feed, create a bonanza
for those on the ground below.

101
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,440
CHIMP SNORTS

102
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,679
A mob of red river hogs.

103
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
HOGS SNORT AND SNIFF

104
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,359
They have travelled over two miles
through the thick undergrowth

105
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,559
to get to this fall of fruit.

106
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,520
But in the African forest,
little comes for free.

107
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,640
This feast is a bribe.

108
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,159
The hogs will carry
the seeds in their stomachs

109
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,800
and deposit them
far from the parent tree.

110
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,880
Night falls.

111
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,119
But one living community,
which is neither animal nor plant

112
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
continues its never ending
work in the darkness.

113
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,039
This ground is alive with fungi that
digest all the litter

114
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,480
discarded by the forest.

115
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,240
Some rare fungi do so with enzymes
that are luminous.

116
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
The local people call them
"chimpanzee fire."

117
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,439
Without the fungi, the dead
vegetation would pile so high

118
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,400
the living trees would be submerged.

119
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,679
Dawn, and a new day reveals just
how much control the jungle

120
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,840
has over its own environment.

121
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,319
The forests of the Congo
are the lungs of Africa.

122
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,959
As they use the sunlight to
build their tissues,

123
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,720
so they release oxygen
and water vapour into the air.

124
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,279
Each hectare of forest produces,
as vapour,

125
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,600
almost 190,000 litres
of water a year.

126
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,880
So much that it
creates its own weather.

127
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Clouds blanket the forest, driving
up the humidity and temperature.

128
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,200
A storm is brewing.

129
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,479
The Congo might be
the richest part of Africa,

130
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,800
but it's also the most violent.

131
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
ROARING THUNDER

132
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,880
BOOMING THUNDERCLAP

133
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,999
Each year, as many as 100 million
lightning bolts

134
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,559
strike the forest.

135
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,119
That's more than anywhere
else in the world.

136
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,360
BOOMING THUNDERCLAP

137
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,080
And with the lightning
comes the rain.

138
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,879
Up to 95% of the rain that
falls here

139
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,160
is generated by the forest itself.

140
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,960
ROLLING THUNDER

141
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,240
With the deluge will come change to
the animals and to the forest.

142
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
It's certainly perfect
weather for frogs.

143
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,999
The big storm is the cue for
the most important climb

144
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,440
of this frog's life.

145
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,240
It's a male in search of a mate.

146
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,600
But if he is to find one,
he has to get to the top.

147
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,079
He needs to keep his wits about him,

148
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,680
for the rain also brings out
hunters.

149
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
Easy does it.

150
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,760
The top, at last.

151
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,640
But he's late to the party.

152
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,800
FROGS CHIRP

153
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,919
The higher a male sits,
the further his voice will carry,

154
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,640
so the top slots are worth
fighting for.

155
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,039
And he's won.

156
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,720
He has the top place.

157
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,159
So now it's time to sing.

158
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,200
FROG CHIRPS

159
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,599
FROG CHIRPS

160
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,200
And a white-bellied
female responds.

161
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,400
They join together to mate.

162
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,400
The loser will have to wait for the
next storm before he sings again.

163
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,879
She lays her eggs on a blade
of a long leaf.

164
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,879
And he, using his back legs,
folds it over

165
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,960
and glues its two edges together,
shutting the eggs inside.

166
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,919
This sealed nest is the safest place
these leaf-folding frogs

167
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,840
can find to protect their precious
brood.

168
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,960
Within days, the eggs are
developing.

169
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,080
The timing is perfect.

170
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,519
The rain washes away the glue
and the tadpoles slip

171
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,480
out of the leaves into the growing
puddles below.

172
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,720
The rainy season reaches its peak
and the ground has been transformed.

173
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,199
The forest is flooded.

174
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,760
It's a new world.

175
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,519
Fish swim in from
the swollen streams,

176
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,160
exploiting this newly created space,
snapping up the drowning insects.

177
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,120
This is a butterfly fish.

178
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,000
A Congo bichir.

179
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
The hunter becomes the hunted.

180
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,320
The butterfly fish is too quick
and leaps out of danger.

181
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,719
The floods gradually drain
back into the established waterways

182
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,640
that run through
the forest like blood vessels.

183
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,639
There is so much water flowing
through the forest that even

184
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,880
little rivulets can carve out
the soil around an ancient boulder.

185
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,399
This is the home of one forest
creature that has lived

186
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,560
here in the Congo
for 44 million years.

187
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,080
Picathartes.

188
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,199
These birds mate for life,

189
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,240
and the male reaffirms the bond
by displaying to the female.

190
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,519
They're building a mud nest
on the underside of the boulder's

191
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,400
overhang, where it'll be
protected from the rain.

192
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,920
The female takes the lead.

193
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,720
The male doesn't seem quite
so skilful.

194
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,640
Oh, dear.

195
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,640
Luckily, she can put things right.

196
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,360
Now she's collecting
the soft furnishings.

197
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,480
He's brought some, too,
but he still can't get it right.

198
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,279
In the end, the female seems
satisfied with the finish...

199
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,720
and just in time.

200
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,320
THUNDER

201
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,799
It might look as if he
has been banished into the rain,

202
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,320
but in fact, they're a great team.

203
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,039
They share the incubation,

204
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,120
12 hours on, 12 hours off,
for the next three weeks.

205
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,159
In due course,
there are mouths to feed,

206
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,760
and now the male must
prove his worth.

207
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,160
Worms are a good start,
and he's doing well.

208
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,200
But the chicks are insatiable.

209
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,280
Fortunately, other things
are on the menu.

210
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,479
He might be a poor nest-builder.

211
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,800
But he is redeeming himself now.

212
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,800
Domestic bliss!

213
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,879
Rocky overhangs are the only place
where Picathartes

214
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,519
will build their nest,

215
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,999
so they owe their home
to the stream that revealed

216
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,840
the flank of the giant boulder.

217
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,999
This stream
and countless others like it

218
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,720
merge to form the great
rivers of Central Africa.

219
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,959
More than 450 billion
litres of rainwater,

220
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,640
travelling down thousands of rivers,
are heading west.

221
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,479
The waters pick up speed
as the rivers spill over the edge

222
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,240
of the central plateau and create
giant cascades of white water.

223
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,519
The Kongou forces its way through
the wildest, most untouched

224
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,200
forest in the whole of Africa.

225
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,919
The Congo river system drains
an area the size of India,

226
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,000
carrying the waters westwards
towards the Atlantic.

227
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,559
But before it reaches the coast,
the rivers broaden,

228
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,080
forcing back the forest.

229
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,080
And here for the first time,
there is space.

230
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,360
Wide, flat and safe.

231
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,840
These stretches of sand attract
visitors from the coast.

232
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,400
Skimmers searching for somewhere
safe to settle.

233
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,879
The lower mandible of their beaks
is greatly elongated.

234
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,200
They slice it through the surface
of the water at ten metres a second.

235
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,960
If and when it hits a tiny fish,
it'll snap shut.

236
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,200
But why come up river to these
open sand flats?

237
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,079
This is the answer.

238
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,120
BABY BIRD CHIRPS

239
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,559
But this nursery will not exist
for long.

240
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,960
Four weeks from now, it'll be
under ten metres of water.

241
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,640
If by then these chicks can't fly,
they will drown.

242
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,919
The problem for young skimmers
is that when they hatch,

243
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,240
the lower part of their beaks
is the same size as the upper.

244
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,879
While they wait for it to grow,

245
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,040
they do their best to learn
the skimming technique.

246
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,360
THUNDER

247
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,519
Open spaces may be safe,

248
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,680
but they give no protection
against the driving rain.

249
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,600
These storms are a warning that
the skimmers must soon leave.

250
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,800
The river is already rising.

251
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,640
This year the chicks get
away in time.

252
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,079
It's not just water that has
the power to clear a way

253
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,400
through the forest.

254
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,360
There are animals that
could do that too.

255
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,999
They have created a network
of pathways that criss-cross

256
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,919
the lowland forest and run
for thousands of miles

257
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,120
in all directions.

258
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,880
CACOPHONY OF ANIMAL SOUNDS

259
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,680
These path-makers are surprisingly
stealthy.

260
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,159
But as night falls, there's a chance
of catching a glimpse of them.

261
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,200
ROAR

262
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,000
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

263
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,720
ELEPHANT ROARS

264
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,159
Forest elephants are very
social creatures,

265
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,200
but in dense jungle it's
hard for them to find one another.

266
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,880
These elephants are lucky.

267
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,439
Here in the Congo, there is one
special place

268
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,280
where they can meet and mingle.

269
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,120
A place that the elephants
have created for themselves.

270
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,520
And this is it.

271
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
ROARING

272
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,760
Dzanga-Bai, the legendary
"village of elephants".

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,080
BABY ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

274

ELEPHANTS ROAR AND TRUMPET

275
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,359
As well as being a place where they
can enjoy one another's company,

276
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,599
this great clearing satisfies
another craving...

277
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,080
for salts.

278
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,480
ELEPHANTS TRUMPET

279
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,239
The salts lie deep under the mud,

280
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,119
so the elephants have got to mine
for them,

281
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,040
which they do with high pressure
water jets from their trunks.

282
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,719
The precious salts

283
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,360
and the chance to socialise bring
in elephants from far and wide.

284
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,799
If an elephant is in the mood to
mate, this is the place to be.

285
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,439
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

286
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,119
This young bull is in a state
of musth, a kind of sexual fury.

00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,240
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

288
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,759
He is so pumped up by hormones
and the excitements of the crowd

289
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
that he seems to have taken leave
of his senses.

290
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,120
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

291
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,719
But will throwing his weight about
impress the females?

292
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,680
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

293
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,279
The cows only become fertile
once every two years.

294
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,639
So opportunities to encounter one
at the right time are not common.

295
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,320
This could well be the first chance
this young male has had.

296
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,239
He's lucky.

297
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,240
And there are no older bulls around
to put him in his place.

298
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,240
Just for a moment,
he is king of the bai.

299
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,320
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

300
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,920
But his rule doesn't last for long.

301
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,600
Enter another lusty bull.

302
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,960
And a much bigger one.

303
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,520
But the young bull is still
charged up with testosterone.

304
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,640
Bold or foolish,
he's going into battle.

305
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,680
He never really had a chance.

306
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,199
Dzanga-bai is a huge clearing,

307
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,040
but it's still just a speck in this
vast expanse of green.

308
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,159
Elephants might fell trees
and carve pathways,

309
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,600
but nothing natural can hold back
this forest for ever.

310
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,840
Nothing but the Atlantic Ocean.

311
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,399
Loango Beach,
on Africa's west coast...

312
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,839
one of the last truly wild places

313
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,800
where the Congo jungle
meets the sea.

314
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:47,159
Here, the forest gives way to sand,
surf and fresh sea air.

315
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:53,999
The cool breezes and warm sunlight

316
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,639
entice creatures out
of the dark forest.

317
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,919
LOWING

318
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,600
Forest buffalo appear first.

319
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,239
And here in the surf...

320
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,520
there are hippo.

321
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,560
Spray blows in from the sea,
making the grass salty.

322
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,319
So here elephants can get
their tasty salt

323
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,080
without having to dig for it.

324
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,519
This mother with her tiny baby
can feel the sun on her back.

325
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,320
Here, it's safe for her little one.

326
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,680
They're free to eat in peace.

327
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,559
The bulls have all the room
they need.

328
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,600
So there is less risk of a fight.

329
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,959
Everyone,
from gorillas to forest hogs,

330
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,519
ventures out to relax on the beach.

331
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,960
BOAR GRUNT

332
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,720
But the forest creatures
can't stay out here forever.

333
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,959
Despite everything...

334
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,999
the intense competition,
the threats, the darkness...

335
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
they need their forest, just as
their forest needs them.

336
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,440
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

337
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,199
The Congo rainforest.

338
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,200
A four-day journey
to the heart of Africa.

339
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,040
Once the plane leaves,
you're on your own.

340
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,479
This expedition planned to film two
of the Congo's best-kept secrets.

341
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,399
But to even find them,

342
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,919
the crew would have to work
very hard indeed.

343
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,919
You might as well be on a
different planet

344
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,560
coming to a place like this,
Planet Congo.

345
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,560
Mysterious...

346
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,399
...difficult...

347
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,439
complex...

348
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,240
challenging.

349
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,320
'You know, everything's
trying to bite you.'

350
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,720
Suck your blood.

351
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,399
It's like being tickled by a million
feathers at the same time.

352
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,159
HE LAUGHS

353
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,600
HE SIGHS

354
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,520
The insects might be torture, but
that's the least of their worries.

355
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,520
The only way to get deep into the
jungle is to follow these trails.

356
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,880
Trails made by dangerous
forest elephants.

357
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,919
'Well, the first thing you need to
know about the forest elephant is,

358
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,559
'you don't want to meet one.'

359
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,199
Cos running away
can elicit a charge,

360
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,240
'and it could be exactly
the wrong thing to do.'

361
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,040
Our team are completely dependent
on their Bayaka guides for safety.

362
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,360
WHISPERS:

363
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,199
But it's these same forest elephants
that James has come to film.

364
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,279
And just to make the challenge
harder,

365
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,800
he's here to film them in the dark.

366
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,119
Nobody knows exactly what
they get up to at night...

367
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,920
they haven't been filmed
like this before.

368
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,719
I couldn't rig this place
if the Bayaka weren't here.

369
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,239
Watching my back, really.

370
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,959
James needs to operate
the remote cameras

371
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,120
from somewhere
out of the elephants' reach.

372
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,200
A tree platform
seems like the best option.

373
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,159
Apparently, they have very big
elephants round here.

374
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,919
They want us to put it
a bit higher, so...

375
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,600
I think I'll do what they say.

376
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,519
But no-one wants to stay out
at night

377
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,360
and help James with the filming.

378
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,159
So James will be alone
until morning.

379
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,839
If anything goes wrong,
he's on his own.

380
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,639
If they really wanted to,
they could push these trees over.

381
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,200
I can't imagine that's going to be
an issue.

382
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,639
As James settled down for the night,

383
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,240
he's got no idea of the trouble
that's coming his way.

384
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,600
What's going on?

385
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:32,839
20 miles away, Mark MacEwen is also
up in the middle of the night.

386
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,159
The animal he's after
is proving impossible to find.

387
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,200
Ah...

388
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,039
So we get up in the darkness and we
walk through the jungle at night,

389
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,119
hoping to hear the sound
of cracking branches

390
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,999
or leaves moving up in the trees.

391
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,399
That means chimpanzees
are stirring in the treetops,

392
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,400
and Mark is here to film chimps
hunting for honey.

393
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,199
There's one chimp in particular
he needs to find...

394
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,799
a teenager with a very sweet tooth,

395
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,560
known to go further in the pursuit
of a bees' nest than any other.

396
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,039
I've spent six days walking,

397
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,799
probably the equivalent of a half
marathon every day in 100% humidity,

398
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,519
and about 95 degrees in the shade.

399
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,360
And we just can't find our
chimpanzee.

400
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,360
Time is ticking away, and Mark
is running out of filming days.

401
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,799
At the moment,
I just need some good luck.

402
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,319
We've come an awfully long way
to get this sequence.

403
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,080
We've got probably 10, 12 days left.

404
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,719
But it's hard work at the moment.

405
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,400
All Mark can do is persevere,
and hope for a break.

406
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,440
But not all the forest creatures
are so shy.

407
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,359
Perched high in his tree,
James Aldred is waiting patiently

408
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,880
for the elephants to come in.

409
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,720
GROWLING

410
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,399
At last, the elephants are here,

411
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,440
but they're behaving strangely.

412
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,719
(He knows something's
not quite right.)

413
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,080
The elephants seem agitated.

414
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,360
They just want to get rid of you.

415
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,519
One begins to thump the tree
with its head.

416
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,919
CRASHING

417
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,480
James has no option
but to weather the attack.

418
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,879
CRASHING

419
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,039
"Let's lean forward
and keep head-butting,"

420
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,360
"keep head-butting,
keep head-butting."

421
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,040
Suddenly, the cameras cut out.

422
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,840
And James is left
in complete darkness.

423
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,559
After three weeks searching, Mark
has lost nearly two stone in weight,

424
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,319
but he hasn't given up.

425
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,600
He can't afford to
put down his camera for a second.

426
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,599
Suddenly, the guide
spots the honey hunter.

427
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,240
This is it.

428
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,759
(Where is she?)

429
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,200
(She's inside the tree.)

430
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,399
Just for some honey,
she's risking her life.

431
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,600
It's amazing.

432
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,680
'Well, I think I just
couldn't stop smiling'

433
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:29,920
for several days after filming.
The relief was just unbelievable.

434
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,720
Back at the camera platform,
James has had a long night.

435
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,640
For over four hours, the elephant
tried to shake him out of the tree.

436
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,799
Got down this morning
when the Bayaka came to collect me,

437
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,919
went to look at the camera, and
he'd pulled it out of the tree,

438
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,880
and he'd chewed
through the power cable.

439
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,879
He must have gotten a bit of a
shock, I mean only 12 volts, but...

440
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,799
Serves him right, quite honestly.
HE LAUGHS.

441
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,079
But at least we got a shot of him
before he trashed the camera.

442
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,399
HE LAUGHS

443
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,600
Silver lining.

444
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,759
Despite this bumpy start, the
elephants soon got used to James,

445
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,159
and James got used to the elephants.

446
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,479
Filming here was never going
to be easy,

447
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,239
but we were soon able to reveal
the night life of forest elephants

448
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,040
like never before.

449
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,760
GROWLING

450
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,320
Next time, Africa's Great Cape.

451
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,280
Where a land of mountains and
deserts is flanked by two coasts.

452
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:14,039
Only in this part of Africa
do powerful oceanic forces combine

453
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,320
in such a riotous explosion of life.

454
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,760
