1
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,239
Africa.

2
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,320
The world's greatest wilderness.

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,480
The only place on Earth to see
the full majesty of nature.

4
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,880
There's so much more here than
we ever imagined.

5
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,279
I'm standing where the equator

6
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,559
cuts right across the middle
of the continent.

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,759
To the north of me,
there's an immense desert

8
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,319
the size of the United States
of America.

9
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,519
To the west, a vast rainforest
the size of India.

10
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,639
And behind me,
for thousands of miles,

11
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,800
the most fertile
savannahs in the world.

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,160
From the roof of Africa...

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,400
...to the deepest jungle.

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,120
Rarely seen places,
and untold stories.

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,400
There's nowhere in the world where
wildlife puts on a greater show.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,519
This is the last place on Earth

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,279
where you can come eye to eye

18
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
with the greatest animals that
walk our planet.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,480
This is Africa.

20
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,399
Our journey starts in the far
south west,

21
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,880
in the oldest and strangest
corner of the continent.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,039
Here, the thirsty land is covered

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,120
with thousands upon
thousands of circles.

24
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,239
We still don't know their origins.

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,239
Poisonous plants, foraging insects

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,560
and even magnetism have all been
suggested, but each ruled out.

27
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,239
The circles don't move,
and their shape never varies.

28
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,680
They're unchanging, much like
this part of Africa itself.

29
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,559
Ancient and arid,
it almost never rains on this land,

30
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,680
yet there is water here,
hidden away.

31
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,120
To survive here, life must use
every trick in the book.

32
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,560
Winter. Dawn temperatures can fall
well below freezing.

33
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,319
And that's a problem
for this drongo.

34
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,720
It's too cold for his normal prey,
flying insects.

35
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,600
But he has a plan. The drongo is
the Kalahari's greatest trickster.

36
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,400
And these are his victims.

37
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,080
A family of meerkats,
desert specialists.

38
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,359
After warming up in the morning sun,

39
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,120
the meerkats begin
their search for breakfast.

40
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,960
The drongo can now begin his tricks.

41
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,080
But he must first win
the confidence of his victims.

42
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,839
He spots an eagle on the hunt,
and sounds a warning.

43
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,319
CHIRRUPING

44
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,000
One that sends the meerkats
gratefully scurrying to safety.

45
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,680
Danger over.

46
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,280
And now, he has their trust.

47
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
He sounds another warning.

48
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,880
CHIRRUPING

49
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,040
But this time, it's a false alarm.

50
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,160
Thank you very much!

51
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,560
The meerkats fell for it.

52
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,239
This all seems too easy.
He tries the same trick again.

53
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,920
CHIRRUPING

54
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,840
BARKING

55
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,000
But the meerkats aren't stupid -
they'll only fall for it once.

56
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,240
The juicy scorpion won't be for him.

57
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,920
Then, suddenly,
the sound of a sentry's warning.

58
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,000
No meerkat can ignore that.
Sentries never lie.

59
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
But the sentry sees no danger.

60
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
Guess who?

61
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,919
Of course, it's the drongo.

62
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,240
He's learnt to mimic the meerkats'
own warning call.

63
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,440
And now, he can enjoy his prize.

64
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,240
A gang of meerkats,
outsmarted by a bird.

65
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,719
The drongo is only deceitful
in the hardest winter months.

66
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,640
For the rest of the year,
he provides honest protection.

67
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,040
So, in the long run, the meerkat
family profit as well as the drongo.

68
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,360
CHIRRUPING

69
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,679
It's a much harder life,

70
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,280
if you haven't yet learned
the tricks of your trade.

71
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,639
This young leopard
is just a year old,

72
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,200
and at a critical point in his life.

73
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,759
His mother has battled to
raise her two cubs,

74
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,560
but finding enough food for them
is now beyond her.

75
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,400
From today, he'll have to
fend for himself.

76
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,680
Kalahari means
"land of great thirst".

77
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,159
Prey is scarce.
Of all the leopards in Africa,

78
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,960
these have to be the most
resourceful.

79
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,239
A big warthog.

80
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,199
Potential prey,

81
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,040
but armed and dangerous.

82
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,560
His mother tried to tackle one,
but it nearly killed her.

83
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,640
He spots something more promising.

84
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,640
A steenbok, that's more like it.

85
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,319
He won't strike unless he can get
to within just four metres,

86
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,840
and without making
the slightest sound.

87
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,039
ANXIOUS YAPPING

88
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,120
A jackal barks an alarm.

89
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,720
But the steenbok still has no idea
it's being stalked.

90
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,920
The nearer he gets,
the quieter he must be.

91
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
He's blown it.

92
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,800
A good opportunity like that
won't come around very often.

93
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,599
Hungry and thirsty,
he heads back home,

94
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,600
and spots a kill stashed in a tree,
almost certainly by his own mother.

95
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,120
And, like any teenager, he thinks
nothing of raiding her larder.

96
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
Booby trapped.

97
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,960
It's not really his day, is it?

98
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,599
Some young leopards grow up to be
brilliant opportunists.

99
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,480
But even they find life hard
here in the Kalahari.

100
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,680
These bizarre little birds
are baby ostriches.

101
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,200
They're just a few days old.

102
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,200
In time, they'll become superb
desert survivors.

103
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,680
But in the Kalahari,
these early days are perilous.

104
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,999
Like leopards and meerkats,
adult ostriches can extract

105
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,479
all the moisture
they require from their food.

106
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,919
The chicks, however,

107
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,880
won't survive much more than
another day without water.

108
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,199
But there's none in sight.

109
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,560
How can their parents conjure up
water out here?

110
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,359
The youngsters follow their parents,

111
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,920
as they head out onto
a featureless wasteland.

112
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,040
It seems like a suicidal journey.

113
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,520
The Etosha salt pan.

114
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,000
Here, water is more often
a mirage than reality.

115
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,440
It's now well over 40 degrees
centigrade.

116
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,880
Their father shades his chicks
from the midday sun.

117
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,920
Another mirage?

118
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,000
No. The ostrich family
is not alone out here.

119
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,639
Surrounded by miles
of sun-baked mud,

120
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,399
sweet, fresh water wells up
from deep below ground...

121
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,160
like a miracle.

122
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,839
Although the ostrich parents have
guided their chicks to water,

123
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,640
there's still a problem - traffic.

124
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,440
Heavy traffic.

125
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,800
These tiny, fragile birds could
easily be trampled under foot.

126
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,560
The water is tantalisingly close.

127
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,560
Where prey gathers,
predators are never far behind.

128
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,760
The brawling lions have unwittingly
done the young ostriches a favour.

129
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,840
The waterhole is now clear.

130
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,920
Sometimes, you need
a bit of luck in life.

131
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,439
Their first-ever drink...

132
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
and just in time.

133
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,600
Their father's done his job.

134
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,960
A black rhinoceros, the Kalahari's
most cantankerous resident.

135
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,319
They don't like company,

136
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,880
and they certainly don't like
sharing a waterhole with lions.

137
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,759
Fortunately -
for everyone else, that is...

138
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,040
they only visit twice a week.

139
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,240
The Kalahari is the black rhino's
last stronghold.

140
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,279
And here, under the cover
of darkness,

141
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,999
at one secret
and very special waterhole,

142
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,479
rhino abandon their normally
solitary life,

143
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,360
and come from miles around
to meet under the stars.

144
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,519
Using the latest starlight camera,

145
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,520
we can reveal for the first time
the rhino's true character.

146
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,319
This young female seems nervous.

147
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,840
She senses other rhinos close by.

148
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,400
A mother appears from the shadows
with her calf.

149
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,680
Tentatively, they greet one another.

150
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,959
They may be ill-tempered by day,

151
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,000
but now they become gentle
and affectionate.

152
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,760
More and more arrive.

153
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,279
We had no idea that rhinos
met to socialise

154
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,320
and build friendships like this.

155
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,040
The young female has an admirer.

156
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,480
But she doesn't seem keen on him.

157
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,959
She's excited about something.

158
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,920
Or someone.

159
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Here comes a really big male.

160
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,040
This time,
she's much more welcoming.

161
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,360
Who would have thought that
rhino could be so flirtatious?

162
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,799
The first male
tries to come between them.

163
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,040
Somehow or other, he's got a pair
of antelope horns stuck on his nose.

164
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,680
It looks as if she's been won over
by his eccentric style.

165
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,040
He leads her off,
away from the party.

166
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,119
He may have style...

167
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,400
but he's turning out to be
something of a disappointment.

168
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,200
GRUNTING

169
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,760
A girl can only put up with so much.

170
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,960
The only way she can get rid of him
is to pretend she's asleep.

171
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,679
To see so many rhino in one place
is a revelation.

172
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,719
And that's the power water has
here - the power to bring together

173
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,440
the greatest gathering of rhinos
anywhere on Earth.

174
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,840
Spitzkoppe.

175
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,879
An ancient volcano,
that towers above a plateau

176
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,240
that is two billion years old.

177
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,919
This land has remained unchanged

178
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,640
for longer than any other part
of Africa.

179
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,199
Animals here have had a long time
to find inventive solutions

180
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,640
to the challenge of finding water.

181
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,719
Out on the open plains, life must
await the chance arrival of rain.

182
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,480
THUNDER RUMBLES

183
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,120
When it does fall,
it has an extraordinary effect.

184
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,159
Each sporadic downpour
may only last minutes,

185
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,480
but it can bring life,
and in spectacular numbers.

186
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,439
Red-billed quelea.

187
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,800
SHRILL CHORUS

188
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,479
They're the most numerous
bird in the world.

189
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,120
In all, more than a billion
live here in the Kalahari.

190
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,599
No-one knows quite how,

191
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,839
but they seem to have an
extraordinary ability to locate

192
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,240
the fall of rain, and then instantly
exploit the bonanza that follows.

193
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,279
These nomads now have just
five weeks to find food,

194
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,360
build a nest and raise a brood.

195
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,280
But they're not alone.

196
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,520
The rains
have also created a plague.

197
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,199
These are armoured ground crickets.

198
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,120
Giant insects, with voracious
appetites... for meat.

199
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,519
With the quelea parents
away feeding,

200
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
their chicks are defenceless.

201
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,760
The adults return.

202
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,120
But the cricket fights back.

203
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,320
Squirting its own foul-tasting
blood into their eyes.

204
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,319
The cricket is still alive,

205
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,200
but the stench of its blood
attracts the attention of others.

206
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,040
Now, IT is the target.

207
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,800
These crickets become cannibals.

208
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,359
All too soon, the bonanza
brought by the rain is over,

209
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,360
and the quelea head off in search
of the next rare downpour.

210
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,159
The Kalahari is scarred by rivers
that have long since run dry,

211
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,320
the water claimed
by the thirsty land.

212
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,520
But it's not gone far.

213
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,399
Deep below lies a secret,

214
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,880
one that was discovered
only 25 years ago.

215
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,279
Humid air rushing to the surface
gives this place its name,

216
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,240
Dragon's Breath Cave.

217
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,800
The shaft descends for 60 metres,
until it meets...

218
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,560
...water.

219
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,639
Here, there is a massive chamber,

220
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,959
big enough to swallow three
jumbo jets, nose to tail,

221
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,560
filled with cool, fresh water.

222
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,760
The world's largest
underground lake.

223
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,760
This is fossil water.

224
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,279
It's been trapped here,
undisturbed, for thousands,

225
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
if not millions, of years.

226
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,240
We have no idea how deep
the lake is.

227
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,679
Divers have been down to 100 metres,

228
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,320
and still there's no sign
of the bottom.

229
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,999
Remarkably, Dragon's Breath
is part of a vast cave system

230
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,640
that extends beneath the Kalahari
for thousands of miles.

231
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,320
Even here, in this lonely cave,
there is life.

232
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,359
Golden catfish,
only found in this one cave.

233
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,080
They're the rarest and most
isolated fish in the world.

234
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,240
Life down here is as challenging
as it is in the desert above.

235
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,359
There's no food,

236
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,640
except the debris that occasionally
falls onto the surface.

237
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,999
And these catfish are totally blind.

238
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The only world they know is
the one they sense through touch.

239
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,399
A blind fish living
in perpetual darkness,

240
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,120
deep beneath one of the most
arid regions of Africa.

241
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Such cruel irony. So much water
hidden away out of reach.

242
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,879
Along the western edge of the
Kalahari, the land becomes so dry,

243
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,440
it seems impossible that any
life could survive here.

244
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,200
The Namib.

245
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,320
A million square miles of sand
exquisitely sculpted by the wind.

246
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,360
This is the oldest
desert in the world.

247
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,760
Respite comes from fog rolling in
from the Atlantic ocean.

248
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,920
It condenses into a few
precious drops.

249
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,320
Just enough to sustain life.

250
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,200
A pompilid wasp is
searching the dunes.

251
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,240
She's not looking for a drink, but
for somewhere moist to lay her egg.

252
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,440
How will she pull off
a trick like that?

253
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,400
The entrance to a burrow.
That's worth investigating.

254
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,239
She may be tiny,
but once she decides to dig,

255
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,200
she can shift extraordinary
quantities of sand.

256
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,440
She's unearthed this spider
for a grisly purpose.

257
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,519
It's so dry, the only place
with enough moisture for her egg

258
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,760
is within the body of
another living thing.

259
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,040
First, she must paralyse her victim.

260
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,720
But then, the spider plays
its trump card.

261
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,999
The aptly-named golden wheel spider
can cartwheel fast enough

262
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
to escape its gruesome fate.

263
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,160
For the wasp, her near
impossible search goes on.

264
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,599
If it's hard enough for a tiny wasp
to survive here in the Namib,

265
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,680
how is it possible for a giant?

266
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
A desert giraffe.

267
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,279
It's difficult to imagine how
such a huge animal

268
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,920
can live in a place with
so little water.

269
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,000
This old male is at the very
limit of his endurance.

270
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,999
The land may be bone dry,

271
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,600
but there are signs that water
once flowed here.

272
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,800
The Hoanib, one of Namibia's rivers.

273
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,600
A river of sand.

274
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,079
The trees that line these
sand rivers send roots down

275
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,720
over 30 metres to tap water that
lies deep beneath the river bed.

276
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,999
These trees are
the giraffe's salvation,

277
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,200
even if he has to stretch to
his very tallest to get a mouthful.

278
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,959
Even on tip-toe, he still needs
a half-metre-long tongue

279
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,800
to reach the leaves
he so badly needs.

280
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,599
He's ruled this stretch
of the Hoanib for over a decade,

281
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,120
and this prime territory is
attracting females.

282
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,200
He waits confidently for her.

283
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,239
But they've got company.

284
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,920
A young male.

285
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,040
The old bull won't tolerate a rival.

286
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,640
Pushing and shoving,
they size each other up.

287
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,160
The young rival seems to think
he has a chance and attacks.

288
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,879
The first few blows usually
settle things in such battles,

289
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,800
but here, the stakes are high.

290
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,000
To lose means exile in the desert.

291
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,720
Neither will back down.

292
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,079
As the fight intensifies,
they change tactics.

293
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,200
The young male aims for the rump.

294
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,640
The old bull
targets his rival's legs.

295
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,120
The old bull is down.

296
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,080
Is this the end of his reign?

297
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,640
He knows a knockout blow is coming.

298
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,840
But the old bull ducks...

299
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,280
...and strikes a blow
to his rival's underbelly.

300
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,880
Out for the count.

301
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,160
The old bull is victorious.

302
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,280
But only just.

303
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,520
The sand river remains his to rule.

304
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,840
It's a river that is about
to be transformed.

305
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,520
Under clear blue skies,
water floods down the Hoanib.

306
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,360
The welcome consequence of rain
that fell hundreds of miles away.

307
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,880
The water may only flow
for a matter of hours.

308
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,239
But this miraculous flood
is enough to provide

309
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,040
a lifeline for the trees and the
giraffes of the Hoanib River.

310
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,040
It's what makes this place
worth fighting for.

311
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,399
Here, fossil lakes,
secret waterholes, desert fog

312
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,639
and ephemeral rivers like this
provide just enough water

313
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,080
for life to get by,
no matter how tough it gets.

314
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,039
It's hard to find more inventive
solutions to staying alive

315
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,240
than in this,
the most ancient corner of Africa.

316
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,599
For four years, the Africa team
searched the continent

317
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,639
for new and surprising stories.

318
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,959
Not only of strange
and unfamiliar creatures,

319
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,160
but also of some we think we know.

320
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,439
Veteran wildlife cameraman
Martyn Colbeck took on the challenge

321
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,080
of shedding new light on the life
of Namibia's desert giraffe.

322
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,079
I jumped at the opportunity
of working with an animal that

323
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,119
I hadn't really spent much
time with.

324
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,359
Straight away, they proved
to be quite an eye-opener.

325
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,919
They're very bizarre
looking animals.

326
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,959
We just kept looking at them
from different angles

327
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,480
and they looked even weirder.

328
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,479
The combination of the sort of
weird close ups, the beautiful

329
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,920
landscape that they're in.

330
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:18,919
They're amusing...

331
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,120
I got really attached
to them, actually.

332
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,040
Overlying all this,
we were always waiting for a fight.

333
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,840
But to see a full-blooded fight
is very rare.

334
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,679
So, the only way that
we were going to see it

335
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,520
is if we stuck at it, day after day,
every day for 30 days.

336
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,720
We were lucky enough that we
found a male guarding a female.

337
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,960
And out of nowhere,
this male came round the corner.

338
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,680
And almost immediately
faced up to our male.

339
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,959
Absolutely no warning that this
was going to happen,

340
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,079
so it was complete
pandemonium in the car.

341
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,439
But luckily I got the camera up
and running in time to actually

342
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,520
capture this fight, and it all came
down to one minute in real time.

343
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,879
When I filmed it,
you don't see it in slow motion.

344
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,560
And you just have to
go with the flow.

345
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,199
You're not experiencing the fight,

346
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,999
you're just basically framing it
and capturing it.

347
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,879
So it was only afterwards, when
we looked at it in slow motion,

348
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,040
that you could really understand
how ferocious it was.

349
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,439
You can see the impact on the skin.

350
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,200
You can see the ripples going
through the flesh.

351
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,119
But it was the final blows
that delivered the real surprise.

352
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,840
It was like one of those
chimneys falling down.

353
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,160
At the last moment,
the head just went clunk!

354
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,920
And we thought it was dead.

355
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,400
We thought this thing was dead.

356
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,200
And it lay there for,
it must have been three minutes.

357
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,439
Eventually, this thing suddenly
got up, the one that was

358
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,919
lying down, and the two of them were
then standing, and then the one that

359
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,159
had been knocked over completely
then just said, "I've had enough."

360
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,160
"OK, OK, you won and I'm off".

361
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,639
I, I think it's very unlikely
I'm going to see

362
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,159
anything like that again.

363
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,280
I think that's a
once-in-a-life-timer. I really do.

364
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,720
It won't be easy to look at
giraffes in the same way again.

365
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,559
On the other side of the desert,

366
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,279
another of Africa's
great animal icons

367
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,319
was attracting
the attention of the team

368
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,960
as they staked out
a secret waterhole.

369
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,639
They hoped to reveal
a very different side

370
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,560
to the personality of
the black rhinoceros.

371
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,640
The team have heard that at night
rhinos behave a little strangely.

372
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,439
A specially-built starlight camera
would allow the team

373
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,200
to pierce the darkness.

374
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,359
It's amazing. That's filming
something we can't even see.

375
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,879
Yeah, and if you look
out there now...

376
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,160
Yeah, it's just black, isn't it?

377
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:24,399
But through this,
it looks as sharp as day.

378
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,639
Rhinos are notoriously anti-social,

379
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,039
yet here they come to revel
in each other's company.

380
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,920
This is amazing.

381
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,159
This is such intimate behaviour,

382
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,239
which you can only see
filming them at night like this.

383
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,680
It's incredible.

384
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,840
But it wasn't just cameras that
would show a new side to rhinos.

385
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,719
By concealing tiny radio
microphones around the waterhole,

386
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,479
the crew hoped to eavesdrop
on the night's activity.

387
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,680
RHINOS GRUNT

388
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,760
And what they heard was astonishing.

389
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,440
RHINO GRUMBLES

390
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,640
They're really talkative.

391
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,760
They really are having a good chat.

392
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,920
These guys are far more
communicative than elephants, even.

393
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,759
They're just going on and on,
chatting away.

394
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,880
SQUEALS AND GRUNTS

395
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,799
It's a beautiful,
crystal clear night,

396
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,720
so we've got beautiful starry shots.

397
00:54:55,721 --> 00:55:00,520
Loads of amazing noise.
Puffing and huffing.

398
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,719
So it's about two in the morning.

399
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,799
There's only one rhino left up there.

400
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,720
The rest of the them
have gone to bed,

401
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:14,560
but he's decided to lie down
right on top of the radio mic.

402
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,960
RHINO GRUNTS AND SNORTS

403
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,239
The crew prepared for one more night

404
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,280
at the waterhole
under the full moon.

405
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,039
It seems that they're
not really here for the water,

406
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,519
but more to socialise.

407
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,120
A bit like going out
for the evening.

408
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,559
He's got some kudu horns on his
face, draped over his nose!

409
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,839
LAUGHTER

410
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,280
Is it all on camera, too?

411
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,599
These images have a particular
poignancy in a world where

412
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:13,239
rhino horn is worth more
than its weight in gold.

413
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,199
Poaching is going through
a really bad time right now

414
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,999
in Southern Africa.

415
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,599
If you averaged it out,

416
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,360
a rhino has been killed every day
for the last year.

417
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,679
That's really serious poaching.

418
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,999
It's a huge concern that what we saw
and filmed just won't happen again.

419
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,080
Ever!

420
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,319
It's only now that technology
has revealed a new side

421
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,440
to the rhino's personality.

422
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,839
The black rhinoceros is
a symbol of the African bush.

423
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,800
But it seems that this creature
has been long misunderstood.

424
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,439
For the Africa team,
revealing giraffes

425
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,840
and rhinos in this new light
was just the beginning.

426
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,519
Africa may be a continent
we think we know,

427
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,600
but it's still full of surprises.

428
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:25,560
Next week, I'll be here on
the great savannahs of East Africa.

429
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:33,600
This is an ever changing land with
a turbulent past and present.

430
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,560
Where animals must gamble
with their lives.

431
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,639
Bounded by mighty mountains
and steaming swamps,

432
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,240
this land is the most prolific
wildlife haven on Earth.

433
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,240
A land worth fighting for!

434
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,160
